An initial public offering (IPO) is the first time a company offers its stock to the public.

Definition
A stock, also called an equity or a share, is an ownership stake in the corporation that issued it.
##  What Are Stocks? 
A stock is a security that represents ownership of a fraction of the corporation that issued it. Units of stock are called [shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp#:~:text=Shares%20are%20units%20of%20equity,in%20a%20distribution%20of%20profits.) and entitle the owner to a portion of the corporation’s profits equal to the number of shares owned. 
Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on public exchanges. The exchanges and the stocks that are listed on them are required to conform to government regulations meant to protect investors from fraudulent practices. 
### Key Takeaways
##  Understanding Stocks 
Corporations issue stock to raise funds to operate their businesses. The holder of stock, a shareholder, may have a claim to part of the company’s assets and earnings. 
Stockholders do not  _own_ a corporation, but corporations are a special type of organization because the law treats them as legal persons. Corporations file taxes, can borrow, can own property, and can be sued. The idea that a corporation is a “person” means that the corporation _owns its assets_. A corporate office full of chairs and tables belongs to the corporation, and  _not_ to the shareholders.3

### Shareholder
A person, company, or institution that owns at least one share of a company’s [stock](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/what-owning-stock-actually-means/)
##  What Is Shareholder Ownership? 
What shareholders own are shares issued by the corporation, and the corporation owns the assets held by a firm. If you own 33% of the shares of a company, it is incorrect to assert that you own one-third of that company. However, you do own one-third of the company’s shares. This is known as “separation of ownership and control.” 
Owning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings, receive [dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) if and when they are distributed, and the right to sell your shares to somebody else. 
If you own a majority of shares, your voting power increases so that you can indirectly control the direction of a company by appointing its board of directors.4 This becomes most apparent when one company buys another. The acquiring company buys all the outstanding shares. 
The board of directors is responsible for increasing the value of the corporation and often does so by hiring professional managers, or officers, such as the [chief executive officer (CEO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceo.asp). Ordinary shareholders do not manage the company. 
The importance of being a shareholder is that you are entitled to a portion of the company’s profits, which is the foundation of a stock’s value. The more shares you own, the larger the portion of the profits you get. Many stocks, however, do not pay out dividends and instead reinvest profits back into growing the company. These [retained earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp), however, are still reflected in the value of a stock.

##  How to Compare Common and Preferred Stock 
There are two main types of stock: [common and preferred](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-preferred-stock-and-common-stock/). 
[Common stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp) usually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders’ meetings and to receive any dividends paid out by the corporation. 
### Fast Fact
The first common stock ever issued was by the Dutch East India Company in 1602.5
Companies can issue new shares whenever there is a need to raise additional cash. This process dilutes the ownership and rights of existing shareholders (provided that they do not buy any of the new offerings). Corporations can also engage in stock buybacks, which benefit existing shareholders because they cause their shares to [appreciate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appreciation.asp) in value. 
##  What Is the Difference Between Stocks and Bonds? 
Conversely, shareholders often receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy, implying that stocks are inherently riskier investments than bonds.2
## How Do You Buy Stock?
Most often, stocks are bought and sold on [stock exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/092404.asp), such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). After a company goes public through an initial public offering (IPO), its stock becomes available for investors to buy and sell on an exchange.
Typically, investors will use a brokerage account to purchase stock on the exchange, which will list the purchasing price (the bid) or the selling price (the offer). The price of the stock is influenced by supply and demand factors in the market, among other variables.
## How Can You Earn Income from Owning Stock?
There are two ways to earn money by owning shares of stock: through dividends and capital appreciation.
Dividends are cash distributions of company profits. If a company has 1,000 shares outstanding and declares a $5,000 dividend, then stockholders will get $5 for each share they own.6
Capital appreciation is the increase in the share price itself. If you sell a share to someone for $10, and the stock is later worth $11, the shareholder has made $1.6
## Is It Risky to Own Stock?
All investments have a degree of [risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp). Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can lose value if market conditions decline.
When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions or corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company.7
Historically, stocks have outperformed most other investments over the long run.1
##  The Bottom Line 
A stock represents [fractional ownership of equity](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052515/can-limited-liability-company-llc-issue-stock.asp) in an organization. It is different from a bond, which operates like a loan made by creditors to the company in return for periodic payments. 
A company issues stock to raise capital from investors for new projects or to expand its business operations. [The type of stock](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041415/what-are-types-share-capital.asp), common or preferred, held by a shareholder determines the rights and benefits of ownership.

## Points to know
See if stocks are a good fit for your investment portfolio.
[Explore our resources](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/stocks)
## Why invest in stocks?
When people talk about investing in stocks, they're usually referring to common stock. These investments let you share in the success of publicly traded companies—with the potential to grow your portfolio with them.
When you purchase stock, you become a part owner of that company. If the company performs well, your investment may increase in value. Conversely, if the company performs poorly, your investment may decline in value.
This ownership can benefit investors in two primary ways.
### Appreciation
When the price of each [**share**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/understanding-investment-types/what-is-a-stock#modal-share) of stock increases in value, the total value of your investment grows. For example, if you purchase 50 shares of stock at $10 per share and the price rises to $15 per share, your investment increases by $250.
### Dividends
Some companies share a portion of their profits with shareholders through [**dividends**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/understanding-investment-types/what-is-a-stock#modal-dividend). If a company announces a $2 dividend per share, you would receive $100 for your 50 shares. You can take the payout as cash or reinvest your dividends to purchase more shares, potentially boosting your long-term returns.
However, not all companies pay dividends. Many growing companies choose to reinvest their profits back into the business instead.
##  Share 
A single unit of ownership in a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or, for stocks, a corporation. 
##  Dividend 
The distribution of the interest or income produced by a mutual fund's holdings to the fund's shareholders, or a payment of cash or stock from a company's earnings to each stockholder. Dividends can be distributed monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.
## **How do stocks work**?
Stock prices change from day to day, and often for reasons beyond a company's actual performance. Market trends, economic conditions, and even news headlines can cause a stock's price to move up or down.
For example, if a competitor releases a new product or a company's growth slows, investors may grow concerned and the stock price may dip accordingly. On the other hand, strong earnings or positive industry developments can boost investor confidence and push prices higher.
While short-term fluctuations are common, a stock's long-term performance is typically tied to the underlying company’s financial strength and ability to grow. Over time, financially sound companies may deliver more stable returns, even though short-term stock prices may still fluctuate.
Understanding the stock market can help you make better investment decisions.

## **Key factors to consider when choosing stocks**
When choosing a company to invest in, it's important to look closely at the fundamentals, like the company's financials, leadership, and competitive position, along with broader industry trends. These factors can help you assess potential risks and long-term opportunities—and make more informed choices.
This process is known as **fundamental analysis** , and it typically includes:
![A red outline icon depicting two buildings, one taller and one shorter, with a large dollar sign inside a circle in the foreground.](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/understanding-investment-types/what-is-a-stock)
###  Company financials 
Earnings reports, revenue growth, profit margins, and debt levels can indicate financial strength.
![A red icon featuring a magnifying glass overlaid on a bar chart with three vertical bars of varying heights.](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/understanding-investment-types/what-is-a-stock)
###  Valuation metrics 
Ratios like price/earnings (P/E) and price/book (P/B) can help you understand how a stock is priced relative to its earnings or assets.
![A red pie chart icon with a dollar sign on the bottom left segment and a percentage symbol on the top right segment.](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/understanding-investment-types/what-is-a-stock)
###  Dividend history 
If you're income focused, consider whether the company pays regular dividends—and whether those payments have remained stable or grown.
![A red icon depicting a bar chart with four vertical bars of varying heights and a line graph with four data points connected by lines above the bars.](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/understanding-investment-types/what-is-a-stock)
###  Industry and market trends 
Evaluate how the company is positioned within its sector and how economic or technological trends might impact its growth.
![A red icon depicting an open hand with a dollar sign coin above it. Three arrows point upwards from the coin, indicating growth or increase.](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/understanding-investment-types/what-is-a-stock)
###  Competitive advantages 
Look for strong leadership, innovation, and other characteristics that set the company apart.
## **How to determine if stocks are the right investment for you**
Stocks can be a powerful investment option with the potential for higher long-term returns, but they can also carry more risk. Before investing, it's important to consider how that risk aligns with your goals and tolerance.
If you're comfortable with market ups and downs—and have a longer timeline—individual stocks may be a good fit. If you're aiming for a more predictable income stream, a lower-risk option like bonds may better suit your needs.
If you do decide to invest in stocks, understanding how they're categorized can make it easier to align your investments with your strategy. Stock classifications highlight key characteristics and market trends.
Here are some of the most common categories of stocks:
### **Growth vs. value stock**
Most stocks fall into one of two broad categories based on how they generate returns for investors:
### **Stocks by market capitalization**
Stocks are also commonly grouped by the total value of a company's outstanding shares, known as its market capitalization. “Market cap” is a key measure of company size and potential risk and return. 
Stocks typically fall into one of three categories:
At the extremes, you may also see mega-cap (over $200 billion) and micro-cap (under $300 million) stocks.
### **Sector-based stocks**
Stocks can also be grouped by sector, based on the type of business a company operates. Each sector responds differently to economic shifts. For example, sectors like consumer discretionary or communication services may be more sensitive to downturns, since people tend to cut back on nonessential spending. But utilities, health care, and consumer staples often remain more stable because they're essential.
Here's a sample classification system and the types of companies that would fall under each sector.
Companies that manufacture products and provide services considered to be nonessential.
Examples:
Companies providing direct-to-consumer products that, based on consumer purchasing habits, are typically considered nondiscretionary.
Examples:
Companies involved in the exploration and production of energy products, such as oil, natural gas, and coal.
Examples:
Companies that provide financial services.
Examples:
Companies involved in providing medical or health care products, services, technology, or equipment.
Examples:
Companies that convert unfinished goods into products used to manufacture other goods or provide services.
Examples:
Companies that serve the electronics and computer industries or that manufacture products based on the latest applied science.
Examples:
Companies that extract or process raw materials.
Examples:
Companies that provide phone, data-transmission, cellular, or wireless communication services.
Examples:
Companies that distribute electricity, water, or gas, or that operate as independent power producers.
Examples:
### **Domestic vs. international stocks**
Stocks can also be categorized by where a business is headquartered. Domestic stocks are shares of companies in your home country. International stocks are shares of companies outside your home country.
[**Investing in international stocks**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/understanding-investment-types/why-invest-internationally) helps diversify your portfolio, reduce dependence on a single economy, and give you access to growth opportunities across different regions. While U.S. companies make up a large portion of the global market, they don’t account for all the investment opportunities worldwide.
### **Common vs. preferred stocks**
Stocks are typically issued as either common or preferred. Each has unique characteristics that make them suitable for different types of investors.
Common stock is the most widely held type of stock. It represents ownership in a company and typically includes voting rights on key corporate matters. Common shareholders may receive dividends, but payments are not guaranteed and are issued only after preferred shareholders are paid. Common stocks tend to be more volatile, but also offer greater potential for long-term growth.
Preferred stock typically does not include voting rights but offers other advantages. Preferred shareholders typically receive fixed-rate dividends—paid before any dividends are issued to common shareholders—and have a higher claim on company assets in the event of liquidation. Preferred stocks may appeal to investors who prioritize a more stable income stream and are comfortable with more modest growth potential.
### **Dividend stocks**
Dividend stocks are shares of companies that regularly distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. These payments are typically made on a quarterly basis and can offer a reliable source of income.
Dividends can help reduce the impact of market volatility by providing consistent returns, even when stock prices are flat or declining.
Companies that pay dividends are often more established and financially sound, but not all dividend stocks are created equal. It is important to evaluate a company's financials, payout ratio, and history of maintaining or growing its dividends over time.
## **Dividends and income from stocks**
When you invest in stocks, you can earn income in two primary ways: through capital gains or through dividends.
Capital gains occur when the value of a stock increases and you sell it for more than you paid. This type of income depends on the performance of the stock and overall market conditions.
Dividends, on the other hand, are typically paid in cash, though some companies offer them in the form of additional shares. While dividend stocks regularly distribute their profits, some companies prefer to reinvest their profits back into the business to fuel growth.
As with all earnings, you will have to pay [**taxes on dividend income**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/taxes/dividends).
## **Diversifying with stocks**
Spreading your investments across a variety of companies, sectors, and regions—rather than a single stock or a handful of stocks—helps reduce risk and makes it less likely that a single company or sector will significantly impact your overall performance.[**Portfolio diversification**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/portfolio-management/diversifying-your-portfolio) can't eliminate risk entirely, but it can help create a more stable investment experience over time.
You can diversify your stock holdings in several ways:
##  Mutual fund 
A type of investment that pools shareholder money and invests it in a variety of securities. Each investor owns shares of the fund and can buy or sell these shares at any time. Mutual funds are typically more diversified, low-cost, and convenient than investing in individual securities, and they're professionally managed.
##  ETF (exchange-traded-fund) 
A type of investment with characteristics of both mutual funds and individual stocks. ETFs are professionally managed and typically diversified, like mutual funds, but they can be bought and sold at any point during the trading day using straightforward or sophisticated strategies.

All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
Investments in stocks and bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.  

Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility.

##  What kinds of stocks are there?
There are two main kinds of stocks, common stock and preferred stock.
**Common** stock entitles owners to vote at shareholder meetings and receive dividends.
**Preferred** stockholders usually don’t have voting rights but they receive dividend payments before common stockholders do, and have priority over common stockholders if the company goes bankrupt and its assets are liquidated.
Common and preferred stocks may fall into one or more of the following categories:
Another way to categorize stocks is by the size of the company, as shown in its market capitalization. There are large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. Shares in very small companies are sometimes called “microcap” stocks. The very lowest priced stocks are known as “penny stocks.” These companies may have little or no earnings. Penny stocks do not pay dividends and are highly speculative.
##  What are the benefits and risks of stocks?
Stocks offer investors the greatest potential for growth (capital appreciation) over the long haul. Investors willing to stick with stocks over long periods of time, say 15 years, generally have been rewarded with strong, positive returns.
But stock prices move down as well as up. There’s no guarantee that the company whose stock you hold will grow and do well, so you can lose money you invest in stocks.
If a company goes bankrupt and its assets are liquidated, common stockholders are the last in line to share in the proceeds. The company’s bondholders will be paid first, then holders of preferred stock. If you are a common stockholder, you get whatever is left, which may be nothing.
Even when companies aren’t in danger of failing, their stock price may fluctuate up or down. Large company stocks as a group, for example, have lost money on average about one out of every three years. If you have to sell shares on a day when the stock price is below the price you paid for the shares, you will lose money on the sale.
Market fluctuations can be unnerving to some investors. A stock’s price can be affected by factors inside the company, such as a faulty product, or by events the company has no control over, such as political or market events.
Stocks usually are one part of an investor’s holdings. If you are young and saving for a long-term goal such as retirement, you may want to hold more stocks than bonds. Investors nearing or in retirement may want to hold more bonds than stocks.
The risks of stock holdings can be offset in part by investing in a number of different stocks. Investing in other kinds of assets that are not stocks, such as bonds, is another way to offset some of the risks of owning stocks.
##  How to buy and sell stocks
You can buy and sell stocks through:
**Direct stock plans.** Some companies allow you to buy or sell their stock directly through them without using a broker. This saves on commissions, but you may have to pay other fees to the plan, including if you transfer shares to a broker to sell them. Some companies limit direct stock plans to employees of the company or existing shareholders. Some require minimum amounts for purchases or account levels.
Direct stock plans usually will not allow you to buy or sell shares at a specific market price or at a specific time. Instead, the company will buy or sell shares for the plan at set times — such as daily, weekly, or monthly — and at an average market price. Depending on the plan, you may be able to automate your purchases and have the cost deducted automatically from your savings account.
**Dividend reinvestment plans.** These plans allow you to buy more shares of a stock you already own by reinvesting dividend payments into the company. You must sign an agreement with the company to have this done. Check with the company or your brokerage firm to see if you will be charged for this service.
**Discount or full-service broker.** Brokers buy and sell shares for customers for a fee, known as a commission.
**Stock funds** are another way to buy stocks. These are a type of mutual fund that invests primarily in stocks. Depending on its investment objective and policies, a stock fund may concentrate on a particular type of stock, such as blue chips, large-cap value stocks, or mid-cap growth stocks. Stock funds are offered by investment companies and can be purchased directly from them or through a broker or adviser.
##  Understanding fees
Buying and selling stocks entails fees. A direct stock plan or a dividend reinvestment plan may charge you a fee for that service. Brokers who buy and sell stocks for you charge a commission. A discount brokerage charges lower commissions than what you would pay at a full-service brokerage. But generally you have to research and choose investments by yourself. A full-service brokerage costs more, but the higher commissions pay for investment advice based on that firm’s research.
##  Avoiding fraud
Stocks in public companies are registered with the SEC and in most cases, public companies are required to file reports to the SEC quarterly and annually. Annual reports include financial statements that have been audited by an independent audit firm. Information on public companies can be found on the SEC’s EDGAR system.

Whether you’re new to [_investing in the stock market_ ](https://www.ameriprise.com/financial-goals-priorities/investing/how-to-invest-in-stock-market)or considering changes to your existing portfolio, the sheer number of stocks to choose from can be daunting.

An Ameriprise financial advisor can help you understand the role that different stocks can play in your investment strategy and help you build a personalized and diversified portfolio that reflects your circumstances, risk tolerance and financial goals.

##  Common stock vs. preferred stock
Stocks represent a piece of ownership in a company, whose earnings and overall success affect long-term returns. It can be issued by the company in two manners: as a common share or preferred share. Here are the key differences between common and preferred stocks:
| **Common stock** | **Preferred stock**  
---|---|---  
_What is it?_ | The default type of stock most investors buy – and what most people think of when investing in the stock market. Most stock is issued as a common share. | A type of stock that shares some characteristics with debt instruments such as bonds. Preferred stock is sometimes called hybrid securities.  
_Voting rights?_ | Common stock typically gives you the ability to vote on key matters such as electing the board of directors or adopting certain company policies. | Preferred stock typically does not come with voting rights, so holders of preferred stock have no say in the selection of board members or governance of a company.  
_Dividends?_ | Depending on the company, common stock may entitle its owner to a share of the company's profits in the form of dividends. | Preferred stock dividends are usually higher and more reliable than common stock dividends.  
_Bankruptcy privileges?_ | In the event of bankruptcy, common stock owners are the last to get any money from the sale of assets. |  Holders of preferred stock get higher priority than common stock for dividend payments and liquidation payments in the event of bankruptcy.

##  Value stocks vs. growth stocks
One common way to look at stocks is by how they can create potential returns for investors. When viewing equities through this lens, stocks generally fall into one of two categories:
##  Large-, mid- and small-cap stocks
One of the most common approaches to categorizing different types of stocks is by market capitalization, which is simply the value of a company’s outstanding shares. It can be helpful to think of market capitalization as a measure of the company’s size.

Being diversified in the types of stocks you own can help reduce exposure to market volatility.
Owning just a select few stocks in your portfolio is highly risky. To benefit from the growth potential of stocks while also reducing your exposure to loss, make sure that the stocks in your portfolio are personalized to your financial goals and are [_diversified_ ](https://www.ameriprise.com/financial-goals-priorities/investing/diversification-asset-allocation)across size, sector, region and industry.
* * *
##  Foreign stocks
While many investors get started by trading in the U.S. stock market, purchasing stocks of companies based in foreign countries is one way to help diversify the regional and global markets your portfolio has exposure to.
##  Dividend-paying stocks
Many companies provide dividend payments to shareholders on a regular basis. Dividend-paying stocks — also known as income stocks — are those that typically offer regular, higher-than-average dividend yields and lower volatility than the overall market. They can provide valuable income for investors but may have limited potential for future growth. Income stocks can be found in any industry but are often companies involved in real estate, energy, utilities, natural resources and financial institutions.
##  Sector stocks
Because stocks from companies in the same industry often move together in response to market or economic events, another way stocks are classified is by sector, which is based on what business they are primarily involved in. The Global Industry Classification Standard divides the market into 11 sectors:
**Sector** | **Types of companies/industries**  
---|---  
_Communication services_ | Telephone, internet, media and entertainment  
_Consumer discretionary_ | Retailers, automakers, hotels and restaurants  
_Consumer staples_ | Food, beverage, tobacco, household and personal products  
_Energy_ | Oil and gas exploration, oil and gas production, pipeline providers and gas station operators  
_Financial_ |  Banking, mortgage financing and insurance  
_Health care_ | Health insurers, pharmaceutical, biotech and medical devices  
_Industrial_ | Airlines, aerospace and defense, construction, logistics, machinery and railroad operators  
_Materials_ | Mining, forest products, construction materials, packaging and chemicals  
_Real estate_ | Property and real estate management, real estate development  
_Technology_ | Hardware, software, semiconductor, communications equipment and IT services  
_Utilities_ | Electric, natural gas, water, renewable energy and multi-product utility

The initial consultation provides an overview of financial planning concepts. You will not receive written analysis and/or recommendations.
**Dividend** payments are not guaranteed and the amount, if any, can vary over time.
**Stock** investments involve risk, including loss of principal. High-quality stocks may be appropriate for some investment strategies. Ensure that your investment objectives, time horizon and risk tolerance are aligned with investing in stocks, as they can lose value.
**International** investing involves certain risks and volatility due to potential political, economic, social, or currency instabilities and different financial and accounting standards. These risks are enhanced for **emerging markets**.
**Growth** securities, at times, may not perform as well as value securities or the stock market in general and may be out of favor with investors.
Generally, **large-cap** companies are more mature and have limited growth potential compared to smaller companies. In addition, large companies may not be able to adapt as easily to changing market conditions, potentially resulting in lower overall performance compared to the broader securities markets during different market cycles.
Investments in **small cap and mid-cap** companies involve risks and volatility greater than investments in larger, more established companies.
**Preferred stock** is subject to issuer default risk. In general, the prices of preferred stocks fall when interest rates rise and vice versa. Yields may vary. The market value of these securities may fall, fail to rise or fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
**Value** securities may be unprofitable if the market fails to recognize their intrinsic worth or the portfolio manager misgauged that worth.
**Asset allocation** and **diversification** do not assure a profit or protect against loss.
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and its affiliates do not offer tax or legal advice. Consumers should consult with their tax advisor or attorney regarding their specific situation.
The **S &P 500 Index** is a basket of 500 stocks that are considered to be widely held. The S&P 500 index is weighted by market value (shares outstanding times share price), and its performance is thought to be representative of the stock market as a whole. The S&P 500 index was created in 1957 although it has been extrapolated backwards to several decades earlier for performance comparison purposes. This index provides a broad snapshot of the overall US equity market. Over 70% of all US equity value is tracked by the S&P 500. Inclusion in the index is determined by Standard & Poor’s and is based upon their market size, liquidity, and sector.
An index is a statistical composite that is not managed. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
**Investment products are not insured by the FDIC, NCUA or any federal agency, are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed by any financial institution, and involve investment risks including possible loss of principal and fluctuation in value.**
