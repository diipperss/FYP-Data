## What is a Shareholder?
Also called a stockholder, they have the right to vote on certain matters with regard to the company and to be elected to a seat on the [board of directors](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/board-of-directors/).
![Shareholder](data:image/svg+xml,<svg%20id="L4"%20xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"%20xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"%20x="0px"%20y="0px"%20viewBox="0%200%201024%20654"%20xml:space="preserve"></svg>)
If the company is getting liquidated and its assets are sold, the shareholder may receive a portion of that money, provided that the creditors have already been paid. When such a situation arises, the advantage of being a stockholder lies in the fact that they are not obliged to shoulder the [debts](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/senior-and-subordinated-debt/) and financial obligations incurred by the company, which means creditors cannot compel stockholders to pay them.
### Roles of a Shareholder
Being a shareholder isn’t all just about receiving profits, as it also includes other responsibilities. Let’s look at some of these responsibilities.
### Types of Shareholders
Common shareholders are those that own a company’s common stock. They are the more prevalent type of stockholders and they have the right to vote on matters concerning the company. As they have control over how the company is managed, they have the right to file a [class-action lawsuit](https://www.consumersafety.org/resources/class-action-lawsuits/) against the company for any wrongdoing that can potentially harm the organization.
Preferred shareholders, on the other hand, are more rare. Unlike common shareholders, they own a share of the company’s preferred stock and have no voting rights or any say in the way the company is managed. Instead, they are entitled to a fixed amount of annual dividend, which they will receive before the common shareholders are paid their part.
Though both common stock and preferred stock see their value increase with the positive performance of the company, it is the former that experiences higher capital gains or losses.
### Can the Shareholder be a Director?
The shareholder and director are two different entities, though a shareholder can be a director at the same time.
The shareholder, as already mentioned, is a part-owner of the company and is entitled to privileges such as receiving profits and exercising control over the management of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the person hired by the shareholders to perform responsibilities that are related to the company’s daily operations with the intent of improving its status.
### [Shareholder vs. Stakeholder](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/stakeholder-vs-shareholder/)
Shareholder and Stakeholder are often used interchangeably, with many people thinking that they are one and the same. However, the two terms don’t mean the same thing. A shareholder is an owner of a company as determined by the number of shares they own. A stakeholder does not own part of the company but does have some interest in the performance of a company just like the shareholders. However, their interest may or may not involve money.
For example, a chain of hotels in the US that employs 3,000 people has several stakeholders, including its employees because they rely on the company for their job. Other stakeholders include the local and national governments because of the taxes the company must pay annually.
### Shareholder vs. Subscriber
Before a company becomes public, it starts out first as a private limited company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of people called “subscribers.” The subscribers are considered the first members of the company whose names are listed in the memorandum of association. Once the company goes public, their names continue to be written in the public register and they remain as such even after their departure from the company.

Definition
Shareholders own a corporation in tandem with other shareholders, each in a percentage equivalent to the number of shares of stock they hold.
##  What Is a Shareholder? 
### Key Takeaways
Yurle Villegas / Investopedia
##  Understanding Shareholders 
A shareholder is an entity that owns one or more shares in a company’s stock or a mutual fund. Shareholders are also often called stockholders. Being a shareholder comes with certain rights and responsibilities. A shareholder is also permitted to vote on certain issues that affect the company or the fund in which they hold shares along with sharing in its overall financial success. 
A single shareholder who owns and controls more than 50% of a company’s [outstanding shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) is referred to as a majority shareholder. Those who hold less than 50% of a company’s stock are classified as minority shareholders. 
Corporate shareholders aren't personally liable for the company’s debts and other financial obligations. Its creditors can't target a shareholder’s personal assets if the company becomes [insolvent](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insolvency.asp). 
### Important
Shareholders are entitled to collect any proceeds that are left over after a company liquidates its assets but creditors, bondholders, and preferred stockholders have precedence over common stockholders who may be left with nothing after all the debts are paid.
##  Rights and Responsibilities 
Being a shareholder comes with certain rights and responsibilities as well as tax implications. 
###  Shareholder Rights 
Shareholders traditionally enjoy the [following rights](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/know-your-shareholder-rights/) according to a corporation’s charter and bylaws: 
###  Shareholders and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
Any gains or losses you realize when selling shares must be reported on your personal income tax return if you're a shareholder. Gains would contribute to your taxable income and losses will be deducted from your taxable income.2 Any dividends paid to shareholders are also taxable income.3
An [S corporation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subchapters.asp) is another type of corporation with different tax treatment. These corporations are typically small to midsize businesses that have fewer than 100 shareholders. The S corporation differs from a regular corporation in that it passes taxation through to its shareholders rather than double the taxation. 
This stands in contrast to shareholders of [C corporations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-corporation.asp). Profits within this business structure are taxed at the corporate level and again at the personal level for shareholders.4
Shareholders incur taxable capital gains or losses when selling shares, however, just as with shares of a regular corporation. 
“Shareholders of S corporations report the flow-through of income and losses on their personal tax returns and are assessed tax at their individual income tax rates. This allows S corporations to avoid double taxation on corporate income. S corporations are responsible for tax on certain built-in gains and passive income at the entity level," according to the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp).5  

##  Types of Shareholders 
Many companies issue two types of stock: [common and preferred](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-preferred-stock-and-common-stock/). Common stock is more prevalent than preferred stock and it's what ordinary investors typically buy in the stock market. 
Common stockholders generally enjoy voting rights but preferred stockholders do not. Preferred stockholders have a priority claim to dividends, however, and the dividends paid to preferred stockholders are fixed even if profits decline. Common stock dividends may decline or not be paid at all during periods of poor corporate performance. 
Some companies further divide their share issues into separate classes with different voting rights. A share in a company's Class A stock might come with 10 votes while Class B shares might have only one vote. There are no hard rules but Class A shares tend to have the highest voting power. 
## What Are the Main Types of Shareholders?
A majority shareholder owns and controls more than 50% of a company’s outstanding shares. This type of shareholder is often a company founder or their descendant. Minority shareholders hold less than 50% of a company’s stock and it may even be as little as one share.
## What Are Some Key Shareholder Rights?
Shareholders have the right to inspect the company’s books and records, the power to sue the corporation for the misdeeds of its directors and/or officers, and the right to vote on critical corporate matters such as naming board directors.
They also have the right to decide whether to green-light potential mergers, to receive dividends, to attend annual meetings, to vote on crucial matters by proxy, and to claim a proportionate allocation of proceeds if a company liquidates its assets.
## What's the Difference Between Preferred and Common Shareholders?
The main difference is that preferred shareholders typically have no voting rights but common shareholders do. Preferred shareholders have a priority claim to income, however. They're paid dividends before common shareholders.
Common shareholders are last in line regarding company assets. They're paid after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders.
##  The Bottom Line 
Shareholders or stockholders are the owners of a corporation. Shareholders can receive profits in the share of dividends or sell their shares in the market for a profit. They can also participate in corporate elections. Anyone can become a shareholder by buying stock in that company. Corporations may also offer employee stock options as a benefit for workers in many countries. 
Shareholders assume a level of risk. Common shareholders are last in line for repayment if a company goes bankrupt. Shareholders can lose their entire investment in some cases.

# What Are the Rights and Responsibilities of Shareholders in a Corporation?
The Law Offices of Steven E. Springer June 10, 2025
* * *
When people invest in a corporation, they often focus on financial returns—but being a shareholder carries more than just the hope of earning dividends. Shareholders play an integral role in shaping the direction of a corporation and protecting their own interests through defined rights and responsibilities. 
At [**The Law Offices of Steven E. Springer**](https://www.springerlawfirm.com/), we work with corporate clients throughout San Jose, California, to help them understand what it means to share ownership in a business. From voting rights to the obligation to act in good faith, shareholders have legal protections but must also act in ways that support corporate stability. 
We’ll walk through the rights shareholders can expect to exercise, the responsibilities they’re expected to fulfill, and how working with a commercial litigation attorney can help when disputes arise.
## Key Rights Shareholders Hold in a Corporation
Let’s start by examining the most important legal rights shareholders typically possess. These rights give them the ability to influence corporate decisions and protect their investments:
While these rights offer meaningful protections, their scope can vary depending on the type of shares a person holds and what’s outlined in the corporation’s bylaws.
## What Responsibilities Do Shareholders Have?
Shareholders don’t just have rights—they also have important duties to the corporation and to fellow investors. These responsibilities help maintain corporate integrity and promote shared success:
These responsibilities help protect the corporation’s financial health and legal standing while encouraging ethical conduct among investors.
## How Shareholders Influence Corporate Governance
Corporate governance defines how decisions get made—and shareholders play a critical role in shaping that process. They’re not just passive investors; they help set the tone for leadership and accountability:
These contributions help create a more accountable and responsive corporate environment—especially when guided by a commercial litigation attorney who understands shareholder rights.
## What Happens When Shareholder Rights Are Violated?
When corporations fail to respect shareholder rights, it can lead to costly disputes and damaged investor trust. In these cases, legal action may be necessary to defend shareholder interests:
Shareholder lawsuits don’t just protect individual rights—they also help maintain accountability within corporate leadership.
## Steps Corporations Can Take to Avoid Shareholder Conflicts
Proactive governance and legal planning can help minimize the risk of internal disputes. A commercial litigation attorney will help corporations structure their governance to avoid costly shareholder battles:
A commercial litigation attorney often plays a behind-the-scenes role in setting up these systems, helping businesses operate smoothly and transparently.
## How Shareholders Can Protect Themselves
Corporations aren’t the only ones who need to prepare—shareholders should also take active steps to protect their own interests:
Active, informed shareholders are an asset to any corporation and can make a difference in governance and accountability.

Reading Time:  4 minutes
A company’s [board of directors](https://www.onboardmeetings.com/blog/board-director-structure-roles-responsibilities/) holds considerable authority within an organization, but they’re not the only voice that matters. Shareholders play a big role in determining the direction of a business. The exact rights of a shareholder change depending on the company and the type of shares they hold. 
This article explains the general powers of shareholders and explains how [OnBoard software](https://www.onboardmeetings.com/why-onboard/directors-trustees/) helps improve the working dynamic between shareholders and senior management.
## What is a Shareholder?
**A shareholder is a person, group, or[legal entity](https://www.onboardmeetings.com/blog/legal-entity/) that owns at least one share of an organization’s stock. You can become a shareholder by investing your own money in the company, obtaining the shares of an incumbent stockholder, or subscribing to the company constitution during incorporation. Owning shares provides each shareholder with rights and obligations regarding the direction of the company.**
## Shareholder Roles and Responsibilities
### 1. Voting
One of the main selling points of becoming a shareholder is that each party gets voting rights during shareholder meetings, but this is only true if you own a certain form of stock. Typically, organizations present two types of stock: common and preferred. Common stocks impart shareholders with the right to vote. These are the most readily available form of shares and what most investors acquire via the stock market. 
The other type of stock is known as preferred shares. While preferred stocks don’t give shareholders the right to vote, they do give stockholders a priority claim to dividends, meaning they receive payment before anyone with common stock. Creditors and bondholders are also paid before common shareholders.
### 2. Monitoring Management
While the day-to-day management of the organization is left to others, shareholders play a vital role within a company’s [corporate structure](https://www.onboardmeetings.com/blog/basics-corporate-structure/). Their equity in the business entitles them to certain governance rights and the final say on decisions, such as:
Shareholder rights are outlined in the organization’s [articles of association](https://www.onboardmeetings.com/blog/articles-of-association/). 
Shareholder decisions are officially made during general meetings (any formal gathering involving a quorum of shareholders), annual general meetings (a yearly meeting between shareholders and board members), or extraordinary general meetings (meetings called to address a pressing matter). 
### 3. Engagement
Shareholder engagement refers to the process of investors and companies developing a healthy working relationship where they exchange and discuss pertinent business information to consistently make quality decisions. Through meetings, private dialogue, and other activities, each party works to create a mutually beneficial exchange that ultimately leads to a better performance in the marketplace and an enhanced reputation for the company. 
### 4. Risk Assessment
Shareholders are also tasked with doing their part to help the company plan and execute its risk management strategy. Their different perspectives help companies identify potential risks before they become serious problems. Mitigating risks early on helps organizations remain legally compliant with all enforced standards and regulations, as well as use their time and resources more efficiently.
### 5. Promoting Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility
Lastly, the oversight of shareholders can push a company to consider more sustainable ways to do business and to practice corporate social responsibility (CSR). CSR is a business model where an organization actively works to take the societal, environmental, and ethical consequences of its decisions into account. This becomes a more pertinent topic as the corporation becomes bigger and more successful. CSR can provide a boost to employee morale and brand reputation, two qualities that can only help a business grow over time. 
## How to Improve Shareholder Relations
It’s natural for shareholders and the board of directors to disagree on occasion. Their goals aren’t always in alignment. Shareholders typically focus on short-term results. Boards of directors may operate on a much longer timeline. Here’s how to cultivate a good rapport between board members and shareholders.
### Effective Communication
All good relationships, whether they’re personal or business, are built on open communication among all parties. Establishing clear communication channels between shareholders and board members helps streamline the exchange of information and address any potential conflicts in a constructive frame of mind. Regular meetings, newsletters, and specified online portals can be helpful tools in this regard. The appointment of an [independent director](https://www.onboardmeetings.com/blog/independent-director/) is another way to bridge the gap between shareholders and management. 
### Accessibility and Engagement
Shareholder mood will also be improved if they have reasonable access to the board of directors on a consistent basis. Creating an environment where investors can express their opinions through meetings, forums, or online platforms will help them feel empowered and valued.
### Corporate Governance and Transparency
For shareholders to fully understand company strategy, board members need to be transparent about the financial and legal status of the company. Providing ample information about the business helps manage expectations and make better decisions.
