## You know that putting money aside for the future is important. But do you know the best strategies to tackle both saving and investing in the years ahead?
Key takeaways
There are some key differences between saving and investing. Both strategies involve accumulating money for future use, but their level of risk is not equal. And how you determine when to save and when to invest will depend on your budget and financial goals.  

Fortunately, you can do both at the same time, which means you don’t have to choose one or the other. 
## Saving vs. investing
Saving is generally considered a good approach if your financial goal can be reached in five years or less, such as planning for a vacation or buying a house. The money you put into a savings account is more liquid than the money you put into investments.
Investing, on the other hand, can help you work toward reaching your longer-term goals, such as retirement or a college fund for your future children or grandchildren. When it comes to investing, patience is key. The longer your money is invested, the more potential it has to grow and earn [compound growth](https://www.usbank.com/financialiq/invest-your-money/investment-strategies/why-compounding-matters.html), which occurs when you reinvest the investment’s earnings to potentially generate more earnings.

## The benefits of investing
Investing’s primary selling point is the potential for long-term wealth creation. Here are a few reasons why:
### How investing works
There are many types of investment vehicles, including:
While you can buy and sell these assets at any time, some types of investments may need more time to mature, and there could be costs or penalty fees associated with selling or removing money from investments before they come to term. Others are more marketable (easier to sell), but you may not want to sell during a market downturn, so it’s better to approach them as long-term investments to get the best potential for growth.
A good way to start investing is through a retirement account. This could be a [401(k), an IRA or both](https://www.usbank.com/financialiq/plan-your-future/retirement/ira-vs-401k-whats-the-difference.html).
Retirement accounts are typically made up of a mix of investment types such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs. You can either set up your own ratio of these investment types, or choose a target date fund, which is an investment mix that’s optimized for your anticipated retirement date.
For example, if you’re close to retirement, your investment mix will often include lower-risk assets, whereas the farther away you are from retirement, the more risk you may be willing to take on, because you’ll have more time to bounce back from any market volatility. 
### Investing key takeaways
## The benefits of saving
While investing can help you achieve long-term financial goals, there should be a place for savings accounts in your financial plan, too. Here are a few benefits of keeping some of your money in a savings account:
### How savings accounts work
Saving is the lower-risk, lower-return option. Savings accounts can come in the form of:
If you deposit money and leave it in a savings account, it will accrue interest over time, but typically at a lower rate than what investments have the potential to provide. You agree to let the bank keep your money for a while (sometimes a set amount of time, as with a CD; sometimes indefinitely, as with a savings account). In turn, the bank gives you a percentage of interest on that cash.
In general, you should begin building savings and pay off high-interest debt before you dive into investing, especially as protection against unexpected costs. The rule of thumb is to have at least three to six months' worth of your household income set aside in an emergency fund. 
### Savings accounts key takeaways
## Risk and rewards of saving vs. investing
Remember, your financial plan should include both savings and investments vehicles, depending on your short- and long-term goals. It’s important to understand both the risks and rewards of savings vs. investing.

## How a financial professional can help
A healthy financial plan isn’t about deciding between saving vs investing. It involves both: saving for goals in the short term and investing for long-term growth.  

Whatever your financial situation and goals, start thinking about both options, and consider discussing your plans with a financial professional.
They can help you put together a financial plan that accounts for both your [short- and long-term goals](https://www.usbank.com/financialiq/manage-your-household/personal-finance/short-and-long-term-financial-goals-for-every-life-stage.html) and advise on the risks and rewards of vehicles that will help you best work toward those goals and build a strong financial future.

Investments in **fixed income securities** are subject to various risks, including changes in interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. Investment in fixed income securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term securities. Investments in lower-rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. **Mutual fund investing** involves risk and principal loss is possible.

# How Does Inflation Affect Savings?
Understand the impact of inflation on your savings and learn ways to protect your financial stability. Stay informed and keep your hard-earned money secure.
Dec 09 2024 | 4 min read
![](https://www.pnc.com/content/dam/pnc-thought-leadership/personal-finance/save/pnc_insights_p_inflation-affect-savings.jpg)
## Article Summary
Have you noticed that the cost of just about everything seems to have gone up lately? Inflation is often the driving force behind these price increases. As inflation rises, the purchasing power of the dollar can shrink. Not only does this affect everyday purchases, it also erodes the value of savings, potentially making it harder to reach financial goals. 
## Understanding Inflation and How It Affects Savings
Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services increases over time. For example, if inflation is at 2%, it means that, on average, prices have increased by 2% compared to the previous year.  
  
When prices go up, money has less purchasing power. If a carton of eggs cost $3.00 two years ago and $5.50 today, the same amount of money now buys fewer eggs.
But how does inflation affect savings? The same principle applies. Even though the amount of money in a savings account might increase or stay the same, its real value decreases over time if the interest earned doesn’t keep pace with inflation. Consider an account that earns 1% interest. If inflation rises by 3%, the account actually experiences a 2% loss of purchasing power. So, while the balance may appear to grow, the money in the account buys less over time, making it harder to reach long-term financial goals. 
## Financial Planning for Inflationary Periods 
With the right financial planning, it’s possible to minimize the effects of inflation on a savings plan. Knowing where to place savings and how to adjust strategies may help protect funds against rising prices. 
### Choosing the Right Savings Accounts
There are several different [types of savings accounts](https://www.pnc.com/insights/personal-finance/save/types-of-savings-accounts.html) to choose from, and some may prove more effective than others in a high-inflation economy. Each has its own benefits, making it important to find one that suits your financial goals. Here are a few options to consider: 
### Strategies for Inflation-Proofing Your Savings
In periods of high inflation, traditional savings accounts may struggle to keep up with the pace of rising costs. High-yield savings accounts may offer a better option, as their higher interest rates may help offset some of the loss in purchasing power. Money market accounts may also be useful, as they tend to provide more competitive rates while still offering easy access to the funds.
Certificates of deposit can lock in a fixed rate, which could prove a disadvantage if interest rates are expected to keep rising. In this case, the fixed rate on the CD would remain the same, even as other savings accounts begin offering higher rates. While a CD may provide stability by offering a guaranteed return, it may result in a lower real return compared to other options that can adjust with changing interest rates. However, purchasing a CD when interest rates have peaked may allow you to lock in a relatively higher rate for a set term.
### Diversify Your Investments
You may consider diversifying beyond savings accounts. Spreading money across different asset classes like stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities often helps balance the risk of inflation. For example, stocks and real estate often appreciate over time and may outpace inflation, potentially making them valuable parts of a well-rounded portfolio.
## Securing Your Financial Future Amid Inflation
As inflation rates and economic conditions change, it’s important to evaluate investment choices and make adjustments as needed. Keeping an eye on real interest rates (the difference between the nominal interest rate and inflation) can help identify which investments are providing positive returns after accounting for inflation.
## Frequently Asked Questions
### How can I protect my savings from inflation?
One way you may be able to protect savings from inflation is to look for savings accounts that pay an annual percentage yield (APY) higher than the current inflation rate. High-yield savings accounts or money market accounts may offer competitive rates. If savings rates fall short, consider diversifying into other investments that may offer better long-term growth. You can also [prepare for inflation](https://www.pnc.com/insights/personal-finance/save/how-to-prepare-for-inflation.html) by creating and sticking to a budget, building up an emergency fund, and proactively adjusting strategies for the current economic conditions.
### Is it bad to save money during inflation?
It’s not necessarily bad to save money during inflation, but it’s important to recognize that cash savings may lose value if the interest earned doesn’t keep pace with rising prices. While having an emergency fund is always wise, it may be better to balance savings with investments that have the potential to grow and outpace inflation. This approach may help maintain purchasing power while also keeping cash on hand for unexpected expenses.
### What are common misconceptions about inflation and its effects?
It’s a common misconception that all savings will lose value equally during inflation. In reality, the effects vary depending on where money is kept. For example, while traditional savings accounts may lag, a high-yield savings account may likely fare better.
Another misconception is that high inflation always leads to economic instability. While inflation can increase costs, a moderate level of inflation is often a sign of a growing economy. Understanding how different financial tools interact with inflation may help you make better decisions about managing money during such periods.

# How inflation impacts retirement savings and investments
Inflation can affect retirement savings and investments by reducing the purchasing power of money over time. As prices increase, the value of fixed-income investments and savings decreases, making it important to consider assets that can keep pace with inflation. Understanding inflation's impact can help in making informed decisions to help protect and grow retirement funds.
## Key takeaways
Navigating inflation 
## What is inflation?
Inflation is a continued increase in the cost of goods and services. If those increases in prices are large and sustained, it can greatly erode the purchasing power of your savings. That means you get less for your dollar. On the other hand, low levels of inflation can also be considered harmful by economists as it can slow growth and depress wages, sometimes even leading to a recession.
When economists talk about inflation, they typically think of it in two ways: expected and unexpected inflation. Expected inflation is just that, the normal level of inflation we’d expect to see. While there is no official rate deemed normal, policy makers and economists generally accept that a healthy target is at or slightly below two percent.1 Unexpected or shock inflation can be loosely defined as inflation above the expected level, especially if it occurs within a relatively brief period.
It can be hard to predict what levels of inflation will occur in the future since it’s impacted by a variety of factors, but there are actions you can take to help combat it. That may include investing your savings and being mindful of your goals.
## **Ways to help preserve your retirement savings against inflation**
There are ways to help hedge your retirement savings against inflation. First, consider whether your savings should be invested as opposed to just kept in a savings account. Funds that are kept in cash will likely decrease in relative value over time. Accounts or investments with low interest and returns may not offer much benefit either.
That’s why it’s important to examine the “real return” on investments. This is the rate of return minus the rate of inflation to quantify the increase in value of your savings. Investing in assets like equities and alternatives can potentially help as they may generate higher returns compared to other strategies. These gains can help offset inflation, however, these higher potential returns come with additional risks when compared to lower returning assets such as cash.
In periods of high inflation, considering certain inflation hedging assets may also be beneficial. That’s especially true as you get older and closer to retirement. But know that returns on most commonly invested asset classes in addition to increases in wages will often outpace inflation. It’s a consideration that younger investors might keep in mind.
When it comes to investing for retirement, a [target date fund](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/education/retirement/what-is-a-target-date-fund) can help manage inflation concerns and appropriately adjust exposure to different asset classes. A financial advisor can also provide advice that is suited to your specific needs and concerns related to inflation.
## **How can inflation impact your retirement goals?**
During periods of higher inflation, you likely feel the impact on trips to the grocery store or at the gas pump. Increased costs can strain your budget today, and also impact the amount you’ll need to [save for tomorrow](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/education/retirement/building-a-retirement-budget).
The good news? Investing your savings could help you beat inflation and preserve their value and growth. You may want to consider [adjusting your savings goals as well to reflect the changing economic landscape](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/education/retirement-volatility-strategies). That may mean aiming to set aside extra savings for retirement if you anticipate needing more. Just as your budget today changes in periods of high inflation, so could spending needs in the long-term for your desired standard of living.
