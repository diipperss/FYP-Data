# How Macroeconomic Analysts Predict Market Trends
![](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dave-in-Media-1.webp)
Understanding how markets behave can feel like trying to solve a complex puzzle. The pieces—like consumer confidence, GDP growth, and employment trends—are all interconnected, yet elusive on their own. [Analysts ](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/)sift through layers of data and economic indicators to uncover hidden trends that shape our financial landscape.
Let’s dive into the fascinating world of macroeconomic analysis and discover how experts are unraveling these intricate patterns.
## **Analyzing Economic Activity**
Macroeconomic analysts assess economic health by analyzing various indicators that reflect the underlying activities within a nation’s economy. Through meticulous examination of data, they look at different sectors such as production, consumption, and labor markets. These measurements aren’t just numbers; they tell stories about how people are interacting within the economy. For instance, when analysts investigate metrics like GDP (gross domestic product), employment rates, and industrial production indices, they gain insights into the robustness of economic conditions.
### **Understanding GDP**
At its core, _GDP_ measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country during a specific timeframe, effectively acting as a snapshot of economic output. Changes in GDP can indicate whether an economy is thriving or struggling. Analysts track these shifts closely because an increase in GDP generally signals economic growth—fueled by factors like heightened consumer spending or increased business investments. For example, the U.S. experienced a notable GDP growth rate of 2.8% in the first quarter of 2025, suggesting a dynamic economy buoyed by flourishing consumer demand and robust business investments.
This leads us to another critical component of economic analysis: employment trends.
### **Employment Trends**
Employment data serves as a crucial lens through which analysts can examine the labor market’s overall well-being. One particularly telling statistic is the _unemployment rate_ , which reflects the proportion of the labor force that is unemployed yet actively seeking work. In April 2025, for instance, the U.S. witnessed a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.5%. While this figure may suggest a healthy labor market, analysts must dig deeper; stagnant wage growth can indicate potential issues lurking beneath the surface, such as underemployment.
When we weave together insights about GDP and employment data, we gauge immediate economic performance while identifying underlying trends that call for attention from policymakers and stakeholders alike.
By closely monitoring these dual layers of economic activity—output via GDP and human engagement through employment—macro analysts are able to provide insightful forecasts for companies planning investments or consumers making spending decisions. This intricate dance between various indicators illustrates how interconnected elements shape our economy’s future trajectory.
With these foundational concepts established, we can now explore more specialized tools and metrics that further illuminate macroeconomic landscapes.

## **Key Macroeconomic Indicators**
Leading, lagging, and coincident indicators each play a vital role in understanding the economy’s trajectory. It’s important to recognize how they interact with each other to paint a comprehensive picture of economic health and performance.
### **Leading Indicators**
Leading indicators are crucial as they provide foresight into where the economy might be headed. They allow analysts to anticipate changes before they manifest in the broader economy. A prime example is the _Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)_ , which captures how optimistic households feel about their financial future. When consumer confidence rises, it often correlates with increased spending, which can subsequently fuel economic growth.
In March 2025, the CCI soared to 134.7, indicating that consumers are likely to open their wallets and spend more in the coming months. This spending typically stimulates various sectors, from retail to services, ultimately having a cascading effect on job creation and overall economic vitality.
Initial jobless claims represent another leading indicator that signals potential changes in the labor market. A rise in claims suggests that businesses could be scaling back their workforce due to anticipated decreases in demand. Conversely, decreasing claims indicate robustness in employment sectors, hinting at an expanding economy.
### **Lagging Indicators**
Turning to lagging indicators, we see how they provide confirmation of trends already established. These metrics help analysts verify whether certain actions have resulted in expected outcomes. The unemployment rate is one such lagging indicator; it reflects the health of the job market after economic shifts have occurred.
As of the first quarter of 2025, the annual GDP growth rate stands at 2.8%. This figure helps us understand economic performance following specific events or trends. If GDP shows improvement post-recessionary periods, we can confidently conclude that recovery efforts may be effective.
While lagging indicators confirm what has been experienced, they should be interpreted carefully; they often report too late for businesses and policymakers to act preemptively. Therefore, they should always be considered alongside leading indicators for a well-rounded view of the economy.
Coincident indicators fill this gap by providing real-time insights into current economic conditions.
### **Coincident Indicators**
Coincident indicators such as industrial production and retail sales offer an instantaneous snapshot of economic activity. They reflect current conditions rather than predicting future movements or confirming past patterns. For instance, recent figures show that U.S. industrial production rose by 1.5% in February 2025.
This uptick indicates a strong manufacturing sector capable of responding to present-day demands, reflecting not just vibrant production capabilities but also underlying consumer and business confidence. Similarly, retail sales figures inform us about consumer behavior right now, effectively telling us whether shoppers are engaging with the market positively or negatively.
By diligently analyzing these key macroeconomic indicators, [analysts ](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/2025/04/09/what-does-a-macroeconomic-analyst-do/)create a framework for informed predictions that will lead us into our exploration of methodologies utilized in economic forecasting.
## **Forecasting Models and Techniques**
Analysts employ a variety of forecasting models to predict market trends with a degree of accuracy. These quantitative methods often hinge on statistical algorithms and econometric techniques, providing a framework for analyzing complex economic data. The foundation of these models is built upon historical trends and patterns that help investors and businesses navigate future uncertainties.
### **Econometric Models**
Econometric models are one of the cornerstones of economic forecasting. They are specifically designed to use historical data to forecast future economic activities. These models take into account regression analysis, where researchers explore causal relationships between various economic variables. For instance, they examine how changes in consumer spending may influence GDP growth.
An excellent illustration of this is the Phillips Curve, which captures the relationship between inflation and unemployment rates in an economy. By analyzing this relationship, analysts can predict inflationary trends based on current labor market conditions. If unemployment falls below a certain threshold, inflation may be expected to rise as more people have disposable income to spend.
Beyond econometric models, analysts also rely heavily on time-series analysis to examine past trends for better insights into future movements.
### **Time-Series Analysis**
Time-series analysis examines patterns observed over sequential time data to identify trends and cyclical behaviors. Analysts use specific models like ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for their ability to forecast future values based on historical data. The beauty of time-series analysis lies in its coherence; it allows for continuous observation of data points unveiling cyclical patterns related to seasons, economic crises, or other significant events.
For example, if a company tracks monthly sales data over several years, it could use ARIMA modeling to effectively assess past performance and product demand trends—turning numbers into actionable insights for stock management or marketing strategies.
While econometric models and time-series analyses are critical for quantitative analysis, qualitative techniques play an equally pivotal role in rounding out predictive accuracy.
### **Qualitative Techniques**
Qualitative techniques capture insights that quantitative data alone cannot provide. Methods such as the Delphi technique or expert panels leverage specialist knowledge to gather opinions about future trends. This process involves engaging with economists or industry experts through surveys or brainstorming sessions, allowing analysts access to real-world experiences that numbers sometimes fail to show.
For instance, researchers might conduct extensive surveys among leading economists to anticipate interest rate movements based on broad economic sentiments or emerging market challenges. Such qualitative insights create a richer picture when combined with robust statistical modeling.
Ultimately, effective forecasting often requires an integrated approach where qualitative insights bolster quantitative findings, producing a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics.
This multifaceted approach sets the stage for exploring the broader factors that shape market behavior and influence business decisions.
## **Influences on Market Trends**
Economic policies are more than just a series of decisions made by governments; they form the backbone of market trends and consumer behavior. When central banks adjust monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates, it can have immediate ripple effects throughout the economy.
Imagine a homeowner faced with high borrowing costs making the decision to delay buying a new home. However, when interest rates drop, that same homeowner might feel empowered to purchase not just a house but also invest in renovations or furnishings. This act of borrowing leads to increased spending, stimulating other sectors. There’s a delicate balance to maintain, as expansive monetary policy can lead to inflation if left unchecked—a double-edged sword in economic management.
On the global stage, strides taken by individual nations can reverberate around the world.
### **Global Economic Events**
International events shape market sentiment and economic stability significantly. For instance, take the tumultuous negotiations surrounding trade agreements—one small shift can cascade into larger economic repercussions. The geopolitical tensions we felt in 2024 serve as a stark reminder of this reality.
As countries grappled with supply chain disruptions due to conflicts overseas, businesses suddenly found themselves struggling to meet demand for goods that seemed readily available just months prior. Such scenarios illuminate the vulnerabilities within our global dependencies, painting a broader picture where single events can alter course trajectories for countless industries ranging from automotive to healthcare.
Yet it is not just external forces that prop up or hinder market progress; domestic activities also play vital roles.
### **Industry-Specific Trends**
Within national boundaries, ongoing shifts within key sectors offer insights into broader economic landscapes.
Look at the technology sector—a juggernaut driving much of today’s economic growth. Innovations in areas like data analytics and artificial intelligence have not only contributed to market expansion but have revolutionized job categories, creating roles scarcely imagined just a few years ago. As companies adapt and grow in response to these advancements, we see a distinct movement within labor markets as workers pivot toward competencies aligned with emerging technologies.
Thus, understanding these industry-specific developments allows macroeconomic analysts to forecast changes with greater precision while aligning strategies tailored towards foreseeable economic adjustments.
By examining these interconnected influences—government policies, global events, and industry advancements—analysts are better positioned to understand market dynamics and anticipate future movements.

##  Abstract
We investigate the impact of macroeconomic surprise and uncertainty on G7 financial markets around COVID-19 pandemic using two real-time, real-activity indexes recently constructed by Scotti (2016). We applies the wavelet analysis to detect the response of the stock markets to the macroeconomic surprise and an uncertainty indexes and then we use NARDL model to examine the asymmetric effect of the news surprise and uncertainty on the equity markets. We conduct our empirical analysis with the daily data from January, 2014 to September, 2020. Our findings indicate that G7 stock markets are sensitive to the macroeconomic surprise and uncertainty and the effect is more pronounced at the long term than the short term. Moreover, we show that the COVID-19 crisis supports the relationship between the macroeconomic indexes and the stock prices. The results are useful for investment decision-making for the investors on the G7 stock indices at different investment horizons.
**Keywords:** New financial risks, COVID-19, Macroeconomic surprise, Uncertainty, NARDL
##  1. Introduction
The aim of the paper is to examine the symmetric and asymmetric relations between the G7 financial market indices and the macroeconomic news surprise and uncertainty over the period from January 2014 to September 2020 using the wavelet approach and the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) framework. Accordingly, we check the short and long-run responses of the individual G7 stock market returns to the daily change in the macroeconomic news surprise and uncertainty indexes developed by [Scotti (2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib57).
Our study contributes to the crisis effects on stock market literature in many ways. First, while earlier studies limited to the COVID-19 crisis effects on the association between macroeconomic indicators and equity markets, we extend it to investigate influence of the change of macroeconomic news announcement surprises and economic uncertainty on stock markets’ behavior considering the role of COVID-19 pandemic on the interaction. Second, our investigation covers different horizons of relationships over the short and long terms using a time–frequency framework. Hence, one of the distinctive features of our paper is the employment of wavelet analysis to explore the linkage between news surprises and financial markets. Moreover, we focus on the short and long-terms asymmetrical effects between the selected stock markets and macroeconomic condition samples. Finally, our study is based on an interesting dataset of macroeconomic news surprise and uncertainty indexes constructed from a set of economic indicators. Those indexes are developed based on the agent expectations, the macroeconomic surprise index measures the degree of ex-post optimism or pessimism about the state of the economy, whereas, the economic uncertainty index measures the uncertainty related to the current economic condition. We use the change on those indexes to identify the macroeconomic risk and their influence on the equity markets.Our findings show that equity markets react significantly to a change in the two macroeconomic indexes. The reaction is more pronounced during the pandemic period for most developed countries, establishing the role of the pandemic in the connectedness between the real and financial spheres. In fact, the results indicate that the symmetric as well as the asymmetric relationships between most the stock indices and the macroeconomic conditions are more robust over the long-run than the short-run. Our findings show the importance of the role of macroeconomic surprises as well as uncertainties for major developed economies in driving the G7 market indices, especially during the turbulent period of the COVID-19 crisis. Overall, this paper conclude that the COVID-19 crisis acts as a systematic risk and contributes to the change of macroeconomic conditions leading to raising of macroeconomic shock. This risk affects the stock market performance. Such findings suggest that the investors should manage the macro risks increased by macroeconomic factor changes due to the pandemic effects.
##  2. Literature review
Meanwhile, the volatility in eight countries declines with good news on the employment situation of the United States, which means that the US employment situation and economic growth have an impact on several emerging equity markets and that positive surprises make several emerging stock markets less volatile. On a similar note, [Esin and Gupta (2017)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib30) examine the effect of US macroeconomic declaration shocks on South African stock market volatility. They show that the turbulence of the South African stock market is not affected by negative reporting regarding US inflation, but that positive news seems to boost it. Unexpected increases in the US rate of unemployment make South African returns more hazardous, whereas unexpected decreases in the US unemployment figures make South African returns less problematic.
According to [Hussain et al. (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib37), the intraday returns and volatility of Brazil and Mexico's stock markets in reaction to US macroeconomic media releases during the times of the US and European economic turmoil have been studied. To summarise, these results show that the market indices' returns are more delicate to economic and financial headlines than are their volatilities; the uncertainty of these indices is acutely susceptible to US news surprises, while a stronger reaction to surprises in Brazil's economy is observed in the Brazilian index. Although other macroeconomic variables have also shown an impact on volatility, it appears that the FOMC's interest rate choices have the most impact. Similarly, Corbet et al. (2020) explored the relation between news reporting and bitcoin returns by constructing an opinion index using news items that follow the declarations of four economic factors: GDP, unemployment, and Consumer Price Index (CPI), and household items. They suggest that the still-emerging cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is further evolving as a result of interactions with economic news. Bitcoin's price tends to decline when there is more positive news after statements on unemployment and consumer durables, while there is a positive correlation between an increase in the number of negative stories accompanying these statements and a rise in the price of bitcoin. On the other hand, it has been discovered that the news about the GDP and CPI does not have any major links with bitcoin.
##  3. Data and methodology
### 3.1. Data
The selection of indicators by [Scotti (2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib57) is guided by several factors. He employs a collection of factors that are widely used by governments, businesses, and central banks as a real-time indicator of the economy's condition. Quarterly real GDP, monthly industrial production (IP), employees on non-agricultural payrolls (or unemployment rate), monthly retail sales, and a survey of the manufacturing sector make up the collection of variables used in this analysis The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) personal income is an extra statistic for the United States. If there is no new data to update these indices, they are identical by construction to their values from the previous day, as evidenced by the fact that the macroeconomic shock and uncertainty indexes are produced daily and updated whenever fresh information becomes available (2016). A modification in these indexes is therefore seen as a sign that new evidence has been made available. If the macroeconomic shock index goes up, it implies that the economy is getting great than predicted, and vice versa, but if the uncertainty index goes up, it shows that individuals are more unclear about the present economy's status. We conduct our empirical analysis with the daily data from January 2014 to September 2020. Notably, our sample period covers the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
[Fig. 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#fig0005) describes the time series prices and squared returns of the G7 stock markets. Notice that each market experiences a significant decrease in prices and high volatility clustering at the beginning of 2020, which can be explained as its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### 3.2. Methodology
We aim to examine the response of the equity markets to macroeconomic surprises and uncertainty at different investment horizons. We employ the time-frequency approach to detect the co-movements between the G7 stock markets and macroeconomic shocks and uncertainty over the short and the long run. In addition, we employ the nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) model to examine the asymmetrical effect of macroeconomic surprises and uncertainty on the G7 stock markets. [Grinsted et al. (2004)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib33) wavelet approach is used in this work because of its capacity to detect co-movements among two-time series that are both stagnant and persistent. This allows us to better grasp the link and causation between time-frequency. We apply continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) and then wavelet coherence to describe the movements of each series of data and the coherence between each variable pair.
#### 3.2.1. Wavelet analysis
The continuous wavelet transform Waa,b displays the projection of a wavelet ψ(.) in contrast to the time sequencet1∈K2R¯, that is,
Wt1(a,b)=∫−∞∞t11√bψt−P®Wdt. | (1)  
---|---  
An essential feature of CWT is its potential to decompose consequently and seamlessly recreate a time series t1∈K2R¯:
t1=1Cψ∫0∞∫−∞∞Wt1(a,b)ψa,btdudbN2,N>0. | (2)  
---|---  
Furthermore, this method can preserve the power of the observed time series sequence:
t12=1Cψ∫0∞∫−∞∞|Wt1(a,b|2dpdbN2 | (3)  
---|---  
Wavelet coherence, a flexible method for determining the successiveness among two series in a multivariate regression model, may help us reach our research objectives. The co-movement between stock markets and macroeconomic surprises or uncertainty indexes can be analysed using both time scales by considering a widely implemented technique irrespective of the time series, such as the wavelet coherence framework. In practice, the cross-wavelet power and the cross-wavelet transform must first be defined. To better understand the cross-wavelet transform, [Torrence and Compo (1998)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib61) suggest that two-time series t1and t2as follows:
Wt1t2(p,q)=Mt1a,bMt2*(a,b) | (4)  
---|---  
where Wt1a,b and Wt2a,brepresent two continuous transforms, the time sequence of t1 and t2, and _**a**_ shows the location index while _**b**_ is the measure, whereas the composite conjugate is shown by (*). The cross-wavelet transform can be used to calculate the wavelet power as |Wt1a,b|. When looking at the time series data, the cross-wavelet power spectrum may be used to identify the area where highly energetic clustering is evident (the cumulus of the restricted variability). It is possible to detect the areas of the time–frequency domain where the connectivity patterns of the observed time series exhibit unexpected and large changes.

#### 3.2.2. The NARDL model: short and long terms asymmetric reaction
In the last step of our analysis, we assess the asymmetric reaction of macroeconomic surprise and uncertainty indexes based on NARDL model, developed by [Shin et al., (2014)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib59). The general form of the asymmetric ARDL approach can be writing as follows:
SPt=β0+β1Surpt++β2Surpt−+β3Unct++β4Unct−+ut | (6)  
---|---  
where SP is the stock market, Surp and Unc are the macroeconomic surprise and uncertainty indexes used as a first and a second independent variable. Whereas, β=( β0,β1,β2,β3,β4) is a vector of long-run parameters to be estimated. The [Eq. (1)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#eqn0005) the Surpt+ Surpt− and Unct+,Unct− are the partial positive and negative change sums of surprise and uncertainty indexes. They are calculated as follows:
Surpt+=∑i=1t∆Surpt+=∑i=1tmax(∆Surpi,0);Surpt−=∑i=1t∆Surpt−=∑i=1tmax(∆Surpi,0)  
---  
Unct+=∑i=1t∆Unct+=∑i=1tmax(∆Unci,0);Surpt−=∑i=1t∆Unct−=∑i=1tmax(∆Unci,0)  
---  
To assess the long-run equilibrium linkage and the dynamic adjustment process, we rewrite the model (6) as follows:
∆SPt=α+β0SPt−1+β1Surpt−1++β2Surpt−1−+β3Unct−1++β′Unct−1−+∑i=1p∅∆SPt−1+∑i=1q(γi+∆Surpt−i++ωi−∆Surpt−i−)+∑i=1φ(σi+∆Unct−i++ρi−∆Unct−i−)+μt | (7)  
---|---  
Where, γi, ωi,σiandρi are the partial sum coefficients in [Eq. (6)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#eqn0030), which explore whether the change of macroeconomic conditions has an asymmetric effect on the equity markets.
##  4. Empirical results and discussion
To investigate the reaction of the equity markets to the macroeconomic surprise and uncertainty indexes of [Scotti (2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib57), we first use the time–frequency framework to detect the symmetric linkage between the stock indices and macroeconomic conditions at different investment horizons and we then apply the NARDL model to examine the asymmetrical effect of surprises and uncertainty on the G7 markets.
### 4.1. Stock markets’ reaction to macroeconomic news surprises and uncertainty: Multi-scale analysis
Applying the wavelet coherence, we examine the co-movements between the macroeconomic surprise and uncertainty indexes and the G7 stock markets. The plots of coherence between the pairs are presented in [Fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#fig0010). Let us start our analysis with the connectedness between the macroeconomic surprises and the G7 equity markets. Overall, we identify several regions with a high degree of co-movement between all the couples before and during the COVID-19 crisis, especially over the low scale. In a comparison of the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, we find that a vast area with a high degree of co-movements between the surprise index and the stock markets occurs during the pandemic period in the cases of the US and Canada, while France, Germany, Italy and Japan present small regions of coherence. Although the euro area shows a weak movement of the surprise index, it has a high degree of co-movement with the CAC 40, DAX and FTSE MIB stock indices. Whereas the UK index is not correlated with macroeconomic news during the pandemic, it shows strong coherence around 2014 and 2018. In the US case, the direction of the arrows is mostly up-right and up-left, respectively, indicating that the surprise index is positively correlated with the S&P 500 index, in which macroeconomic surprises lead and lag, respectively. The Canadian pair establishes a negative relationship, in which the surprise index leads the S&P/TSX 60 indexes. The euro area surprise index and stock market pairs present a positive correlation according to the direction of the arrows, which the stock market leads. In the UK’s case, the arrows point up-left around 2014, which means that the pair is negatively correlated when the FTSE 100 leads. Furthermore, the surprise index is negatively correlated with the UK stock market around 2018, and the surprise index leads. Finally, the linkage between the Japanese index and macroeconomic surprises is positive over the middle scale and negative over the long scale during the pre-COVID-19 period. On the other hand, an in-depth look at the wavelet coherence plots between the uncertainty index and the stock market pairs shows that the pandemic period is characterized by vast regions of high connectedness. From the arrows’ directions, we identify bidirectional causality between each coupled pair, and the correlation oscillates between a positive and a negative relationship, especially during the pandemic. To conclude, these results clearly indicate that the pandemic has enforced the relationships between most of the G7 indexes and news surprises as well as economic uncertainties. Overall, looking at the wavelet coherence plots between each pair, we can see over the high scale that the cold colour is dominant; however, we identify a very small number of small islands of high connectedness. Thus, we can say that, although there are some small areas of concentration of co-movements, the response of G7 markets to macroeconomic surprises and economic uncertainty is very weak compared with that in the long run before and during the pandemic period.

In the following, we investigate the asymmetric response of G7 stock markets to macroeconomic surprise and economic uncertainty indexes using the NARDL model. The results for whole sample period are presented in [Table 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#tbl0015). We note first that the asymmetric effects of macroeconomic surprise and uncertainty is mixed for all stock markets. In the one side, the short-run coefficients related to positive change on surprise is positive at 1% significance level for the case of Italy and Japan, while the negative change of surprise is positive for US and Japan and it negative for UK and Canada at 5% significance level. For the positive and negative change of economic uncertainty, we note that the short-run coefficients related to positive change have a negative influence at 5% significance level on US, France, Germany and Italy stock markets. Whereas, the negative change of uncertainty have a positive impact on Canada, France and Germany indexes. For the Japan, we find that the stock index responds positively and negatively to the negative change of uncertainty based on the result of selected _t_ , _t-6_ and _t-8_. In another side, looking to the long-run coefficients shows asymmetric effects of macroeconomic conditions on most stock markets. For US, the positive change of uncertainty has a positive effect on the stock index at 5% significance level. Similar results are obtained for the Canadian market. Whereas, Japan index negatively impacted by the negative surprise and positive uncertainty. Meanwhile, the negative uncertainty has a positive repercussion on the Japan market. However, the asymmetric results for Euro countries and UK indicate no asymmetric response to the macroeconomic indexes at the long-run.

In the following, we examine the asymmetric linkage during the COVID-19 crisis period using the NARDL model to explore the role of the pandemic on the asymmetric response of the G7 market to the macroeconomic index. As the date of beginning of lockdown period is different from country to another,[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#fn2) the COVID-19 sample starts from the first day of the lockdown to the end of the sample period for each country.
The results concerning the short and long-run asymmetric linkages between the stock market and both macroeconomic condition indexes during the COVID-19 outbreak are presented in [Table 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#tbl0020). Concerning the short-run findings, we find that the positive change of surprise has a positive influence on Italy and Germany stock markets at 5% significance level. Whereas, it have a negative effect on France index only at 1% significance level. While, the negative change of the surprise coefficient is positive for France, Germany, Italy and Japan at 1% significance level. Nevertheless, for the short-run uncertainty impacts, we find that the positive change affect negatively France, Germany and Italy markets at 1% and 5% significance levels, respectively. Furthermore, the negative change of uncertainty has a negative influence on the three euro index at 1% significance level, whereas it affect positively at 1% significance level the Japan market. While US, Canada and UK show a symmetry linkage at the short-run. In contrast, for the long-run asymmetric effects of macroeconomic condition on stock markets, we find that the negative change of the surprise affect negatively the US, France, Italy and Japan index at 1% and 10% significance levels, and it affects positively the German index. Whereas, the positive change of the surprise shows a negative influence on France and Japan stock markets. However, it has a positive impact on German stock index. Moreover, the negative and positive change of uncertainty also present a long-run effect on most stock markets. German stock market responds negatively to negative uncertainty, whereas, France and Japan stock market respond positively. The positive change of uncertainty affects positively the France market and also exhibit a negative impact on US and German stock markets. However, the Canadian and UK indexes show a symmetry linkage.

##  5. Results discussion
Our findings provide many important recommendations for speculators and investors in the G7 markets at different investment horizons, considering the effect of macroeconomic news and economic uncertainty on the main stock markets. According to the wavelet approach, the macroeconomic surprise index shows a weak response, and this is related to the effect of the lockdown policy and the harsh restrictions leading to the economic recession during the pandemic. The wavelet coherence exhibits a high level of connectedness between most equity markets and the news surprise and uncertainty indexes over the long-term. Indeed, the effect is most pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic between the economic uncertainty index and the financial stock markets. This finding is expected because the COVID-19 crisis causes damageable consequences for financial markets, and the uncertainty about the end date of this crisis increases the economic uncertainty levels and the fear in the financial markets. Therefore, the repercussions of the pandemic support the connectedness between stock indices and uncertainty ([Sharif et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib58)).
Overall, this paper indicate that the macroeconomic conditions can plays an important role in driving the stock market behaviours. The unpredictable macroeconomic condition change is the main source of the macroeconomic risk which is an aggregate reflection of economic health for a nation. This risk defined as the change in financial asset prices due to persistent shocks to the real economy (see [Winkelmann et al., 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib64)). Our study reveal that the macro-risk increased during the pandemic due to the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on the economy. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the global economic system experienced two shocks i.e. demand and supply shocks, which contributes to the rising of the macroeconomic risk. This is expected because the pandemic is considered as a systematic risk which affect the entire economic factors leading to high macroeconomic risk, and then directly influence the financial markets.
The results of stock markets’ sensitivity to macroeconomic announcements and uncertainty may be applied for asset pricing and portfolio selection and for the assessment of investment horizon decisions with respect to macroeconomic state releases. The reported data about the state of the regional economy impacts stock prices behaviors. Thus, if the statistics about the macro-economic indicators are more (less) that investor’s expectation, this will lead stock prices to go up (down). Nonetheless, the stock market responds more noticeably to unexpected economic changes which can make it unpredictable. Overall, our results highlight that investors should pay more attention to the change on the economic conditions.
##  6. Conclusion
The effect of macroeconomic indicators on the financial markets is one of the most important topics covered in the literature during the last two decades. This study aims to revisit the relationship between the macroeconomic state and the stock market indices, including the COVID-19 period. To this end, we apply the wavelet approach and the NARDL model to investigate the relationship at different investment horizons and the asymmetrical linkage between the individual G7 stock markets and two real-time indexes: the macroeconomic news surprise and uncertainty indexes developed by [Scotti (2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib57). Our findings from the wavelet coherence documents a high degree of connectedness between the individual G7 stock markets and the news surprise and uncertainty indexes over the low scale. We document that the strongest interconnection is between the G7 stock indices and the uncertainty index, especially during the pandemic. Furthermore, we can see clearly that, in the short term, the connectedness levels are weaker than at the low scale. In another side, the NARDL model reveal evidence of asymmetric linkage between the equity markets and each macroeconomic condition index at short- and long-run for most G7 economies. Overall, we provide that the effect of positive and negative macroeconomic shocks are impacted by the pandemic period, which imply that the COVID-19 crisis affects the asymmetric associations.
Our study highlights the importance of the role played by macroeconomic surprises and economic uncertainty on the stock market behaviors, especially during the COVID-19 crisis. Several practical implications can be derived from such finding for policymakers as well as heterogeneous investors. The macroeconomic risk coming from the change of the economic factors have proven to be highly correlated to the stock market prices at long-term than short-term. Finally, the date concerning the [Scotti (2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9830854/#bib57) indexes is available only for the developed economies. For that reason, we didn’t investigate the effect of macroeconomic surprises for non-G7 countries such as emerging economies (like BRICS and Asian economies). Future research should overcome this limitation.

## Abstract
## Introduction
The literature shows evidence of investor underreaction to corporate events. The most well-known phenomenon is the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) in stock returns (Ball and Brown, 1968, Foster et al., 1984; and Bernard and Thomas, 1989, Bernard and Thomas, 1990). That is, firms reporting positive (negative) unexpected earnings, on average, experience positive (negative) abnormal returns following earnings announcements. A number of potential explanations have been proposed, from both rational and behavioral perspectives, for investor underreaction. Several studies attribute underreaction to limited investor attention and investor cognitive constraints (e.g., Hirshleifer and Teoh, 2005, DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009, Hirshleifer et al., 2009). For example, Hirshleifer et al. (2009) find that the immediate investor reaction to a firm's earnings surprise is much weaker and the drift to earnings surprise much stronger when a larger number of companies announce earnings on the same day, evidence that investors are distracted by concurrent earnings announcements of other firms.
In this paper, we extend the existing literature and examine how investors allocate attention between firm-specific news and macroeconomic news. Moreover, we are interested in how investor attention to macroeconomic news affects market response to earnings announcements. Our study is motivated by the following arguments and observations. Based on psychological evidence that attention is a limited cognitive resource (Kahneman, 1973), Peng and Xiong (2006) show that limited investor attention leads to category-learning behavior. That is, investors tend to process information about macroeconomic fundamentals before processing firm-specific information, such as earnings news. In addition, many investors employ a top–down approach in their portfolio management. The first decision in a top–down portfolio management approach is the desired risk–return trade-off based on the macroeconomic fundamentals and outlook. These investors also have priority of processing macroeconomic news over firm-level news. We provide empirical evidence supporting the predictions of investor category-learning behavior. That is, macroeconomic news attracts investor attention to the overall market and, as a result, investors allocate relatively less attention to firms announcing earnings on days with important macroeconomic news announcements than on other days. However, the total attention allocated by investors to earnings news and macroeconomics news is higher on days with macroeconomic news announcements.
We argue that despite the distracting effect of macroeconomic news announcements on investor attention, the higher total attention to earnings news and macroeconomic news should help investors better understand the information content of earnings surprises. This is because earnings surprises contain both systematic and firm-specific components (Patton and Verardo, 2012, Konchitchki and Patatoukas, 2014, Savor and Wilson, 2016). The literature shows that macroeconomic news announcements reveal important information about economic fundamentals and discount rates (Flannery and Protopapadakis, 2002, Boyd et al., 2005, Savor and Wilson, 2013, Li et al., 2014). Thus, we hypothesize that investor attention to macroeconomic news helps investors disentangle the systematic component from the firm-specific component of earnings news, leading to more efficient market responses to earnings surprises and weaker underreaction. In particular, we expect that the effect of macroeconomic news is mainly driven by firms with high exposure to macroeconomic news. Moreover, such effect is expected to be stronger when macroeconomic news contains more information and for firms with greater information uncertainty. These arguments are formally presented in Section 2.
We perform empirical tests of the above hypotheses. The data used in our study include the IBES database for analyst earnings forecasts, the CRSP database for stock returns, Compustat for firm characteristics, and Bloomberg for macroeconomic news announcement dates and surveys of market participants. We restrict our sample to common stocks traded on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ. The sample period is from January 2001 to December 2013.
To examine the effect of macroeconomic news on investor reaction to earnings surprises, we analyze market reactions to earnings announcements with concurrent macroeconomic news announcements and market reactions to those without. The results show a significantly higher immediate market reaction to earnings announcements with concurrent macroeconomic news announcements. The spread in abnormal returns between the top and bottom deciles of analyst forecast error (FE) is 7.063% over the two-day announcement window for earnings announcements without concurrent macroeconomic news announcements and is significantly higher, at 7.528%, for earnings announcements with concurrent macroeconomic news announcements. As a result, the drift following earnings announcements with concurrent macroeconomic news announcements is significantly weaker. For earnings announcements without concurrent macroeconomic news announcement, the average return differentials between the top and bottom FE deciles are 1.545% and 3.735% over five- and 30-day post-earnings announcement windows, respectively. For earnings announcements with concurrent macroeconomic news announcements, these corresponding numbers are significantly lower, at 1.271% and 2.710%, respectively. The findings are consistent with results in a recent study by Sheng (2017) who documents that price reactions to earnings news are stronger and the post-earnings announcement drift is weaker on days with macroeconomic news announcements. To understand the mechanism behind the empirical findings, in our study we further conjecture that attention to macroeconomic news announcements helps investors understand the systematic component of earnings news. To test the hypothesis, we divide stocks into subsamples with high and low exposure to macroeconomic news based on abnormal market beta on days with macroeconomic news announcements. The results show that the effect of macroeconomic news is mainly driven by firms with high exposure to macroeconomic news.
One concern is that our findings may be driven by management timing of earnings announcements based on the schedule of macroeconomic news announcements. To address the concern, we perform two sets of analyses and show that the main findings of our study are not driven by potential management timing of earnings announcements. First, we compare variations in reporting lags for earnings announcements on days with macroeconomic news announcements to those on other days and find no evidence of management timing of earnings announcements based on pre-scheduled macroeconomic news announcements. Second, we replicate our analysis based on only on-time earnings announcements and show that the results are consistent.
We perform additional analyses to confirm that the results are robust when we control for other firm and earnings characteristics, as well as lagged stock returns. DellaVigna and Pollet (2009) find less immediate responses and more drift for earnings announced on Fridays, when investor inattention is more likely than on other weekdays. We thus include a day-of-week dummy to control for potential weekday effects. In addition, Hirshleifer et al. (2009) show that market response to earnings is affected by earnings announcements of other firms, we include the number of concurrent earnings announcements and its interaction with earnings surprise as control variables. We also find that the results are robust when we exclude the financial crisis period. Moreover, we divide macroeconomic news into different categories and show that the effect is pervasive for different types of macroeconomic news.
Furthermore, we provide evidence to support the conjecture that the information content in macroeconomic news helps investors interpret earnings news. First, we show that the information content in macroeconomic news directly contributes to the effect on market reaction to earnings announcements. Using the magnitude of market returns on days with macroeconomic news announcements as a proxy of information content in macroeconomic news, we divide our sample period into sub-periods with high and low information content. The results show that macroeconomic news announcement has a stronger effect on market reaction to earnings news when it conveys more information to investors. Second, the literature documents that investor underreaction is stronger for firms with greater information uncertainty (Jiang et al., 2005, Zhang, 2006, Francis et al., 2007). If macroeconomic news helps investors interpret earnings news, we expect the effect to be stronger for firms with greater information uncertainty. Using analyst coverage as a proxy for firm-level information uncertainty, we find a stronger effect of macroeconomic news on investor reaction among firms with lower analyst coverage.
Finally, we provide direct evidence that macroeconomic news helps reduce uncertainty in stock returns and enhance efficiency in stock prices. Using the realized volatility of daily stock returns as a proxy for stock return uncertainty, we show that stock returns following earnings announcements with concurrent macroeconomic news announcements indeed have significantly lower realized volatility. Similarly, based on the autocorrelations of daily stock returns and the variance ratio test, we show that stock prices following earnings announcements with concurrent macroeconomic news announcements behave more like random walks. These findings are consistent with the conjecture that macroeconomic news helps reduce uncertainty in earnings news and helps incorporate earnings information into stock prices.
Our study contributes to the following strands of literature. First, our study contributes to the literature on investor category-learning behavior. We show empirical evidence supporting the predictions of Peng and Xiong (2006) for investors with limited information processing power. Second, our study adds to the literature on investor distraction. We show that despite the distracting effect on investor attention, the total attention to macroeconomic news and earnings news helps investors understand both the systematic and firm-specific components of earnings news, leading to more efficient responses to earnings surprises. Finally, our study contributes to the literature on the effect of macroeconomic news announcements on stock valuation. Savor and Wilson (2014) show that stock prices behave more rationally on days with important macroeconomic news announcements. Our study presents evidence that higher attention allocated by investors to the market on days with macroeconomic news announcements offers a plausible explanation for why stock valuations are more efficient.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops the main hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data and methodology. Section 4 performs the main empirical analysis and various robustness checks, with further analysis in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.

## Data
The main data used in our empirical analysis include the IBES database for analyst earnings forecasts, the CRSP database for stock returns, Compustat for other firm characteristics, and Bloomberg for macroeconomic news announcement dates and survey of market participants. The CRSP stock returns are adjusted for delistings to avoid survivorship bias, following Shumway (1997). The stock sample includes common stocks traded on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ in the CRSP database. Bloomberg provides the
## Investor attention to macroeconomic news and earnings announcements
The category-learning behavior of Peng and Xiong (2006) predicts that investors generally pay more attention to macroeconomic news announcements and, therefore, allocate less attention to firm-level news. In this section, we empirically test such implications.
First, we examine whether investors pay more attention to the overall market on days with important macroeconomic news announcements than on other days. We use trading volume and absolute market return as proxies for investor attention,
## Further analysis
The results in Section 4 show a significantly stronger immediate market response and weaker PEAD for earnings announcements with concurrent macroeconomic news announcements. In this section, we perform further analysis to substantiate the argument that macroeconomic news helps incorporate earnings information into stock prices. First, we provide evidence that the information content in macroeconomic news directly contributes to its effect on investor reaction to earnings announcements. Second,
## Conclusion
In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the allocation of investor attention, a limited cognitive resource, to macroeconomic news versus firm-level news and the effect of macroeconomic news on investor reaction to earnings announcements. We show that macroeconomic news attracts investor attention to the overall market and distracts investor attention on earnings announcements. The evidence is consistent with the predictions of category-learning behavior of Peng and Xiong (2006) for
