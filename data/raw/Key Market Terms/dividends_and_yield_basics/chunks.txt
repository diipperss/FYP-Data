Definition
Dividend yield is a ratio that demonstrates a company's annual dividends relative to its shares' market price.
##  What Is the Dividend Yield? 
A stock's dividend yield is a ratio showing how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. The reciprocal of the dividend yield is the dividend payout ratio. 
### Key Takeaways
Investopedia / Michela Buttignol
##  Understanding Dividend Yield 
Dividends are payments made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually derived from the company's profits. These payments represent a portion of the company's earnings that is distributed to its investors as a reward for their ownership. 
The dividend yield is an estimate of the dividend-only [return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp) of a stock investment. Assuming the dividend is not raised or lowered, the yield will rise when the stock price falls. Conversely, it will fall when the price of the stock rises. 
Because dividend yields change relative to the stock price, it can often look unusually high for stocks that are falling in value quickly. New companies that are relatively small, but still growing quickly, may pay a lower average dividend than mature companies in the same sectors. Generally, mature companies that aren't growing very quickly pay the highest dividend yields. 
Dividends can be issued in various forms, including cash payments, additional shares of stock, or other property. The most common form is cash dividends. 
###  REITs, MLPs, and BDCs 
Along with REITs, master limited partnerships (MLPs) and [business development companies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bdc.asp) (BDCs) typically also have very high dividend yields. The structure of these companies is such that the U.S. Treasury requires them to pass on the majority of their income to their shareholders.2 This is referred to as a "pass-through" process, and it means that the company doesn't have to pay income taxes on profits that it distributes as dividends.3
### Fast Fact
A high dividend yield may not always be great. For example, a company may be better off retaining cash to expand its business, so investors are rewarded with higher capital gains via stock price appreciation.
##  Calculating the Dividend Yield 
The formula for dividend yield is as follows:
Dividend Yield=Annual Dividends Per SharePrice Per Share\begin{aligned}&\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{ \text{Annual Dividends Per Share} }{ \text{Price Per Share} } \\\\\end{aligned}​Dividend Yield=Price Per ShareAnnual Dividends Per Share​​
The dividend yield can be calculated from the last full year's financial report. Alternatively, investors can also add the last four quarters of dividends, which captures the trailing 12 months of dividend data. Using a trailing dividend number is acceptable, but it can make the yield too high or too low if the dividend has recently been cut or raised.
Because dividends are paid quarterly, many investors multiply the last quarterly dividend by four and use the product as the annual dividend for the yield calculation. 
Finally, some companies pay a dividend more frequently than quarterly. A monthly dividend could result in a dividend yield calculation that is too low. When deciding how to calculate the dividend yield, an investor should look at the [history of dividend payments](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/071616/history-sp-500-dividend-yield.asp) to decide which method will give the most accurate results. 
##  Advantages and Disadvantages of Dividend Yields 
###  Advantages 
Historical evidence suggests that focusing on dividends may amplify returns rather than slow them down. For example, according to analysts at Hartford Funds, 85% of the total returns from the [S&P 500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) are from reinvested dividends. This assumption is based on the fact that investors are likely to reinvest their dividends back into the S&P 500, which then compounds their ability to earn more dividends in the future.4 Note that any historical dividend statistics may not reflect dividends in the future. 
A company's ability to consistently pay and increase dividends is often a strong indicator of its financial health and stability. Companies that generate sufficient profits and cash flow are more likely to distribute dividends to their shareholders. Therefore, a stable or growing dividend yield can be a signal that a company is in good financial standing. 
Regular dividend payments can also boost shareholder confidence, signaling that management is confident in the company's future and earnings potential. This consistent payout demonstrates that the company generates sufficient profits to share with its shareholders. Not only is this another signal of good financial health, but it can also indicate that management has a plan for the future and believes it does not need cash flow for future success. 
###  Disadvantages 
High dividend yields may be attractive, but they may also come at the expense of the potential growth of the company. It can be assumed that every dollar a company pays in dividends to its shareholders is a dollar that the company is not reinvesting to grow and generate more [capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp). Even without earning any dividends, shareholders have the potential to earn higher returns if the value of their stock increases while they hold it as a result of company growth. 
It's not recommended that investors evaluate a stock based on its dividend yield alone. Dividend data can be old or based on erroneous information. Many companies have a very high yield as their stock is falling. If a company's stock experiences enough of a decline, it may reduce the amount of the dividend or eliminate it. 
Investors should exercise caution when evaluating a company that looks distressed and has a higher-than-average dividend yield. Because the stock's price is the denominator of the dividend yield equation, a strong downtrend can increase the quotient of the calculation dramatically. 
Pros
Cons
##  Dividend Yield vs. Dividend Payout Ratio 
When comparing measures of corporate dividends, it's important to note that the dividend yield tells you what the simple rate of return is in the form of [cash dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashdividend.asp) to shareholders. 
The dividend payout ratio represents how much of a company's net earnings are paid out as dividends. While the dividend yield is the more commonly used term, many believe the dividend payout ratio is a better indicator of a company's ability to distribute dividends consistently in the future. The dividend payout ratio is highly connected to a company's cash flow. 
The dividend yield shows how much a company has paid out in dividends over the course of a year. The yield is presented as a percentage, not as an actual dollar amount. This makes it easier to see how much return the shareholder can expect to receive per dollar they have invested. 
### Fast Fact
Dividends can be awarded as additional stock, cash, or other forms of consideration. Keep this in mind when calculating the value of dividends received.
##  Tax Considerations of Dividends 
The manner in which dividends are taxed is just as important as how they are paid. Dividend income tax treatment varies significantly across different jurisdictions and can ultimately influence investors' net returns. 
For example, [qualified dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp) are taxed in the United States at a lower rate than ordinary income, with rates ranging from 0% to 20% depending on the investor's tax bracket. This preferential treatment is designed to encourage investment in dividend-paying stocks. Non-qualified dividends, however, are taxed at the individual's regular income tax rate, which can be substantially higher. 
The reason this is important to note is that the dividend yield may not ultimately be an investor's rate of return. If the taxpayer has a high individual tax rate, the investor's true net take-home proceeds may be 20% less than the dividend yield. Just as capital gains can vary based on the retirement vehicle in which they are held, dividends and their associated dividend yield may be impacted by taxes. 
##  Dividend Yields and Inflation 
Dividend yields can serve as an effective hedge against inflation, helping investors preserve their purchasing power over time. When companies pay dividends, they provide a regular income stream that can be particularly valuable during periods of rising prices. For instance, as a company's revenue grows, potentially due to charging higher prices to capture inflationary pressure, that growth could be passed along to investors. 
However, this is only true when dividend payments increase. Should a company decide to retain cash flow for growth purposes, a stable dividend yield may be unfavorable, especially during inflationary periods. For instance, during the global pandemic, the United States experienced an unprecedented government stimulus that resulted in high inflation; corporations that did not increase their dividend yield actually eroded the purchasing power of those dividends.5
##  Examples of Dividend Yield 
Suppose Company A's stock is trading at $20 and pays annual dividends of $1 per share to its shareholders. Suppose that Company B's stock is trading at $40 and also pays an annual dividend of $1 per share. 
This means Company A's dividend yield is 5% ($1 ÷ $20), while Company B's dividend yield is only 2.5% ($1 ÷ $40). Assuming all other factors are equivalent, an investor looking to use their portfolio to supplement their income would likely prefer Company A over Company B because it has double the dividend yield. 
###  Real-World Example 
To calculate the dividend yield for a company like Microsoft, you would follow these steps: 
## What Does a 10% Dividend Yield Mean?
A 10% dividend yield means a company annually pays 10% of its stock price in dividends. A company might be able to afford this high yield, but it might indicate an issue with its stock price. Additionally, the company should consider reinvesting more of its profits into growth.
## Is Dividend Yield Monthly?
Dividend yield is calculated using total annual dividend amounts, not monthly or quarterly.  

## What Is a Good Dividend Yield for a Stock?
It depends on the company and its financial circumstances. Generally, less than 4% is considered safe, while higher percentages increase risk. A careful analysis of the company, its financial reports, and market conditions should be conducted to determine whether a higher yield is good.  

##  The Bottom Line 
Many stocks pay dividends to reward their shareholders. [High-yielding dividend stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/the-best-dividend-stocks-8783124) can be a good buy for some value investors, but may also signal that a stock's share price has recently fallen by quite a bit, making the legacy dividend comparatively higher in relation to the share price. A high dividend yield could also suggest that a company is distributing too high a portion of its profits as dividends rather than investing in growth opportunities or new projects.

## When investors look for income from stocks, [dividends](https://www.heygotrade.com/en/blog/what-is-a-dividend/) are often the first thing they consider. But the size of a dividend alone does not tell you much. What matters is how that dividend compares to the stock’s price. This is where dividend yield comes in.
Dividend yield helps investors understand how much income a stock generates relative to its price. It is widely used in income investing, portfolio comparison, and valuation analysis.
This guide explains the dividend yield meaning, how the dividend yield formula works, and the key risks investors should understand before relying on it.
## What Is Dividend Yield?
Dividend yield shows how much a company pays in dividends each year as a percentage of its stock price.
In simple terms, it tells you how much income you earn from dividends for every dollar you invest in a stock.
Dividend yield is usually expressed as a percentage and is updated as stock prices and dividend payments change.
## How Does Dividend Yield Work?
Dividend yield combines two simple inputs: the annual dividend and the current stock price.
### 1. Understand the dividend yield formula
The basic dividend yield formula is:
**_Dividend Yield = Annual dividend per share ÷ Stock price_**
This formula helps standardize dividend income so investors can compare different stocks more easily.
### 2. Stock price affects yield
Dividend yield changes even if the dividend stays the same.
This is why dividend yield should always be viewed alongside price movement and company fundamentals.
### 3. Dividends are not guaranteed
Dividends are paid at the company’s discretion. They can be increased, reduced, or suspended depending on profits and financial conditions.
## Dividend Yield Example
Imagine [a stock ](https://www.heygotrade.com/en/blog/what-is-a-stock/)trading at 50 dollars per share.
The company pays an annual dividend of 2 dollars per share.
Using the dividend yield formula:
Dividend Yield = 2 ÷ 50 = 4 percent
This means you earn 4 percent per year in dividend income, before taxes, assuming the dividend stays the same and the stock price does not change.
If the stock price falls to 40 dollars and the dividend remains 2 dollars, the yield rises to 5 percent. If the price rises to 80 dollars, the yield falls to 2.5 percent.
## Why Investors Use Dividend Yield?
### It helps compare income potential
Dividend yield allows investors to compare income from different stocks, even if their prices are very different.
### It supports income focused strategies
Income investors often target stocks or [ETFs](https://www.heygotrade.com/en/blog/what-is-an-etf-definition-how-to-invest/) with consistent and sustainable dividend yields.
### It provides context for total return
Dividend yield is one part of [total return](https://www.heygotrade.com/en/blog/total-return-is-definition/), alongside price appreciation.
### It helps evaluate valuation signals
Unusually high dividend yields can sometimes signal undervaluation, but they can also signal trouble.
## Risks of Relying on Dividend Yield
Dividend yield is useful, but it comes with important risks.
### High yield can be misleading
A very high dividend yield may result from a falling stock price rather than a strong dividend policy. This can be a warning sign.
### Dividends can be cut
Companies can reduce or eliminate dividends during downturns, even if they paid consistently in the past.
### Yield ignores growth
Focusing only on yield may cause investors to miss companies that reinvest profits for long term growth rather than paying high dividends.
### Taxes reduce actual income
Dividend income is often taxable, which lowers the effective yield investors receive.
## Dividend Yield vs Dividend Payout
Dividend yield and dividend payout are related but different.
A sustainable dividend usually requires a balance between yield and payout.
## Conclusion
Dividend yield shows how much income a stock generates relative to its price. It is a useful tool for comparing income potential, but it should never be used in isolation.
By understanding how dividend yield works and the risks behind it, investors can make better decisions and avoid chasing yields that may not last.

### Key takeaways
Some companies make dividend payments as a way of sharing some of their profits with stockholders. [Dividend investing](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/dividend-stocks "Dividend investing") can potentially help provide steady investment income—even during periods when the market is down. Dividend yield can come in handy when comparing dividend stocks and deciding which ones to invest in. Here’s a closer look at what it is, how it works, and how to calculate it.

###  What is dividend yield?
Dividend yield is the percentage return rate that a company pays in dividends, based on its current dividend rate and stock price. It gives investors an idea of how much annual income they might expect from dividend payments, assuming the dividend doesn’t change.
As a quick example, if a company pays $1 in annual dividends per share, and its share price is currently $25, its dividend yield would be 4%. (Keep reading for more on the calculation.)
###  How does dividend yield work?
Keep in mind that the dividend yield is a ratio. If either the share price or the dividend payment changes, the yield will also change.
**What increases the dividend yield?**
The dividend yield can increase if:
**What causes the dividend yield to drop?**
The dividend yield can fall if:
However, these effects can also cancel each other out or magnify each other. For example, if the dividend payment and the stock price both rise, the dividend yield could end up staying the same.
###  What is the dividend yield formula?
Dividend yield is a simple formula:
**Dividend yield = (annual dividends per share) / (current share price)**
That will give you a decimal figure, which you can convert to a return rate by multiplying by 100. For example, a decimal dividend yield of 0.05 represents a return rate of 5%.
How do you figure out the annual dividends that a stock pays out per share? There are 2 ways of doing this:
###  How to calculate dividend yield
To calculate a stock’s dividend yield, just take the total annual dividends that the company pays out (using one of the methods above) and divide that number by the company’s current share price.
Let’s consider a company with a current share price of $100. Over the past year, the stock has paid out the following quarterly dividend payments:
Using the backward-looking method, add up all 4 payments and divide by 100. This method would result in a dividend yield of 3.04%.
Using the forward-looking method, take the most recent dividend payment and multiply by 4. Following this method, you’d have a slightly higher dividend yield of 3.08%.
###  FAQs about dividend yields
**Do all companies pay dividends?**
No, not all companies pay dividends. Large, established companies often do. Young or high-growth companies often do not.
**Where can I find a company’s dividend yield?**
Visit Fidelity’s [stock research](https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/research/src "stock research") page, and search for the company’s name or ticker symbol. In the “Detailed quote” section of the page, look for “Estimated distribution rate/yield.” For dividend stocks the estimated distribution yield is the dividend yield.
**How do I find companies with the highest dividend yield?**
Fidelity customers can screen and sort companies by dividend yield using the [Fidelity stock screenerLog In Required](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/stock-screener "Fidelity Stock Screener") . However, as the next section explains further, just because a company has the highest dividend yield doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the strongest or highest-returning investment.
###  What is a good dividend yield?
It can be tempting to go with the [stocks that offer the highest yields](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/high-dividend-stocks "stocks that offer the highest yields"). After all, a high yield means you’re earning more from your investment, right? Not necessarily. Companies can decrease or stop their dividends at any time, so the current dividend yield is not a guaranteed return rate.
In fact, a very high dividend yield can actually be a red flag that the company is struggling. For example, it could indicate that:
That’s why dividend investors often focus instead on looking for steady dividend payers—companies that have a long track record of paying consistent dividends without cuts—instead of simply highest dividend payers.
It’s also important to note that high-growth companies often don’t pay dividends, because they choose instead to reinvest all of their profits back into the business. This can help fuel future earnings growth—potentially helping to lift the stock price down the line.
The key takeaway here is that a high dividend yield isn’t necessarily a good thing and a low dividend yield isn’t necessarily a bad thing.
###  What is the average dividend yield?
Dividend yield can vary significantly depending on the company and industry. Average dividend yields across the market can also shift over time. For example, dividend yields are often higher when interest rates are higher and lower when interest rates are lower.
That said, dividend yields of major market indexes can be helpful yardsticks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500® Index was 1.24% as of July 31, 2025.1
###  What affects dividend yield?
Again, dividend yield is directly affected by a stock’s share price and dividend payments. When either of these things change, it affects the stock’s dividend yield. Bear in mind that share prices are constantly in flux. So a company’s dividend yield can change even day to day.
###  How are dividend yields taxed?
A stock’s dividend yield is a financial ratio, not a payment to investors, so the dividend _yield_ itself is not something that can be taxed. Dividend payments, on the other hand, are taxable.
For a dividend to be qualified, investors must generally meet certain [holding period requirements](https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/qualified-dividends "holding period requirements").
###  Why is dividend yield important?
Dividend yield is an important factor to weigh before purchasing a stock, particularly if you’re buying a stock for its dividend income. Unlike the dollar value of a company’s dividend payments, dividend yield is a standardized metric, which means investors can use it to compare stocks with each other.
Just be sure to understand the metric’s limitations, and always do thorough research before buying individual stocks.

Dividend investing is an investment strategy that focuses on stocks that distribute dividends. Dividends are payments made by companies — in the form of stock or cash dividend — typically on a quarterly basis.
When investing in dividend-payers, investors can potentially profit in two ways:
## Dividend Stocks: What They Are and How They Work
Every company makes a capital allocation decision on how much of their net income to reinvest towards growth versus returning to shareholders. A dividend is the portion of income that the company decides to return to shareholders. Companies can issue dividends in the form of additional stock or cash.
Companies that issue consistent dividends provide returns to investors in the form of steady income. By contrast, many growth companies believe in their ability to generate higher value for shareholders by using proceeds for expansion or capital investments. The board of directors decide whether to pay out the company’s profit in dividends.
Mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) also issue dividends. This usually is the result of underlying stocks held by the fund issuing a dividend, which are then passed to shareholders of the fund. 
Quick Quiz
Are higher dividends always better than lower dividends? If ETF A issues a dividend of $4 per unit and ETF B issues a dividend of $3, is ETF A better?
You are right! Higher dividends are not necessarily better than lower dividends. Read the section "What is Dividend Yield?" to learn more.
Higher dividends are not necessarily better than lower dividends. Read the section "What is Dividend Yield?" to find out why.
## What is Dividend Investing?
Dividend investing is an investment strategy focused on instruments that issue regular dividends. You can invest directly in stocks that have a history of issuing regular dividends or in ETFs or mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of dividend-yielding stocks.
## What is Dividend Yield?
Not all dividends are created equal. To judge the comparative attractiveness of a dividend, you need a measure that normalizes for underlying stock price to provide an equal footing for evaluation.
One such measure is the dividend yield. To calculate dividend yield, divide a company’s annual dividend per share by the current share price. Dividend yield is the measure of dividend you have earned for every dollar invested.
_Dividend Yield = (annual dividend received per unit or share)/(price per unit or share)_
For example, imagine ETF A issues a dividend of $4 per unit and ETF B issues a dividend of $3 and that each unit of ETF A costs $40 and each unit of ETF B costs $20. The dividend yield of ETF A works out to be ($4/$40) 10%, whereas the dividend yield of ETF B works out to be ($3/$20) 15%. If all else is equal, ETF B with its higher dividend yield would provide a higher return than ETF A.
## Types of Dividend Investing Strategies  

Broadly, dividend investing strategies fall into one of two categories based on the criteria being followed and the investment goals targeted.
**High Dividend-yield Strategies** target companies with high levels of dividend yield. These strategies have the potential to offer a high level of dividend income and the opportunity for capital appreciation.
**Dividend Growth Strategies** focus on investing in companies with a history of consistently growing their dividends. The ability to grow dividends consistently over long periods of time demonstrates qualitative attributes, such as fiscal discipline and operational efficiencies, and can potentially lead to growth from dividend income as well as capital appreciation. ETFs built with this strategy usually track indices of stocks that have grown their dividends over consistently long periods of time.
## Benefits of Dividend Investing
Investing in stocks that provide high dividend yields helps investors to:
1
Generate Passive Income 
Dividend-paying stocks can be a source of passive and regular income. Companies use stable and increasing dividends as a signal of confidence in their firm’s prospects, while market participants consider such track records a sign of corporate maturity and balance sheet strength.
2
Reduce Risk/Volatility 
Dividend payments potentially can provide a cushion to losses that occur from a decline in stock price. The embedded quality bias of companies that consistently increase dividends may also weather market drawdowns better than broad market indices.¹
3
Limit Tax Impacts 
Qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income for certain investors, making those dividends potentially a tax-efficient means of obtaining income.
## Risks of Dividend Investing
When considering where and how to invest, consider:
**Tax Implications  
**Some dividends may be taxed as income, unless they are in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s or an IRA. Thus, dividend investing may increase your tax liability. This is true of reinvested dividends as well.
**Low Growth Potential  
**Companies that pay regular dividends are naturally reinvesting less into growing the company, which could impact the total return.
**Possible Policy Changes  
**Even companies that have a history of offering regular dividends may decide not to issue dividends in a particular year in reaction to changing economic conditions or company-specific factors. As companies are not obligated to distribute dividends, dividend income is not guaranteed.
## Dividend Investing Mistakes to Avoid
When implementing any investing strategy, investors run the risk of overlooking factors that can end up having a large impact on returns.
**The Dividend Value Trap  
**Relying solely on dividend yield as a metric for investing often leads investors to chase high yields at the cost of high risk to their capital. A high dividend yield may not always signify high total return. The average dividend yield from S&P 500 companies fluctuates between 3% and 5%.2 It’s prudent to be wary of very high payout ratios that are funded by debt and declining cash flows.
**Choosing Dividend over Company Fundamentals  
**Chasing dividend payouts without considering the quality and durability of a company can lead to issues like shrinking dividend yields, loss of capital, and volatility in total returns. Therefore, look for companies with competitive strength, long-term expected earnings growth, strong cash flow, and a low debt-to-equity ratio.
## How Do Dividend ETFs Benefit Investors (and Limit Risks)?
The ETF structure itself provides some [potentially useful benefits](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/resources/education/etf-benefits-for-investors). The following benefits can enable dividend investors to:
1
Reduce Tax Liability 
Because ETFs rarely distribute capital gains, ETFs can potentially [reduce the tax liability](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/resources/education/etfs-and-tax-efficiency-what-you-need-to-know) of investors. By reinvesting profits rather than declaring dividends, ETFs can offset the tax implications that come with dividend investing. Make sure your ETF due diligence includes checking the fund’s history of dividend distributions.
2
Rely on Index Tracking to Pick High Dividend Companies 
Since many high dividend yield ETFs track indexes, the process of vetting companies is done for you. 
3
Reduce Costs 
ETFs typically have lower management fees and operating expenses compared to mutual funds. The average expense ratio for index ETFs is 0.57% versus 0.87% for mutual funds.³ When expenses and fees are low, investors keep more of their returns.

**Dividend Equities  
**Equity securities that pay dividends. A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company’s earnings, decided by the board of directors, to a class of its shareholders. Dividends can be issued as cash payments, as shares of stock, or other property. Equity, also known as stock, is a type of security that signifies ownership in a corporation and represents a claim on part of the corporation’s assets and earnings.  
  
**Dividend Equity Investing  
**A style of investing focused on owning companies or a portfolio of companies that make distributions and, in turn, reinvesting those dividends regularly with a view to slowly accumulating wealth over the long term. 
**Dividend Paying Stock  
**An equity security that pays a portion of company earnings in a payout to certain shareholders, usually on a quarterly basis. In recent years, increasing numbers of mutual funds and ETFs have begun combining such dividend-paying stocks into larger equity portfolios designed to augment income-generation at a time of low bond yields.
**Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)  
**An ETF is an open-ended fund that provides exposure to underlying investment, usually an index. Like an individual stock, an ETF trades on an exchange throughout the day. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be sold short, purchased on margin and often have options chains attached to them.
**Tax Efficiency  
**A term that describes various approaches to investing that minimize tax liability. Certain types of investments, including funds like ETFs or securities like municipal bonds are valued for their tax efficiency, as are tax-protected accounts such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) or Roth IRAs. Also, certain practices, such as tax-loss harvesting, which is designed to lighten tax obligations, are considered ways to pursue greater tax efficiency.
**Value Trap  
**A stock or stock fund that appears to be trading below its intrinsic value, but that fails to increase in price. The stagnant share prices of value trap investments might indicate that a particular company or entire sector may be challenged, and that valuations may not be moving higher.
**Volatility**  
The tendency of a market index or security to jump around in price. Volatility is typically expressed as the annualized standard deviation of returns. In modern portfolio theory, securities with higher volatility are generally seen as riskier due to higher potential losses.
