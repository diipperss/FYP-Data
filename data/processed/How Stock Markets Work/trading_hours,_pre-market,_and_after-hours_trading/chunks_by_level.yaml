title: How Stock Markets Work
summary: >
  This lesson explains how stock markets operate across regular trading hours,
  pre-market, after-hours, and overnight sessions. It highlights how liquidity,
  spreads, and execution risks differ outside normal hours and what investors
  should consider when trading during these periods.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: Trading sessions—when the market is most “normal”"
  summary: >
    Learn the main trading sessions (regular hours, pre-market, after-hours) and why prices can look different
    depending on the time. You’ll understand the simple reason: liquidity is not equal across sessions.
  key_points:
    - Regular trading hours have the most participants, volume, and liquidity.
    - Pre-market and after-hours exist, but fewer traders participate.
    - With lower liquidity, bid–ask spreads tend to widen and prices can jump more.
    - Extended hours prices can move a lot on small trades and may not represent full market consensus.
    - Timing matters: the same order can fill at very different prices depending on the session.
  subtopics:
    - What “regular trading hours” means (highest liquidity window)
    - Pre-market and after-hours (basic idea)
    - Why spreads widen when fewer people trade
    - Why a quoted price isn’t always a tradable price (thin liquidity intuition)
  examples:
    - Earnings release example: >
        A company releases earnings after market close, causing its stock to spike in after-hours trading.
        Early traders may capture price moves, but face higher risk due to thin liquidity.
    - "Simple spread example: During regular hours a stock might have a $0.01 spread, but after-hours it could widen to $0.10, increasing the cost of entering or exiting."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming extended-hours prices reflect full market consensus.
    - Using market orders (where allowed) when liquidity is thin and being surprised by the fill.
    - Thinking “the market is closed” means nothing happens to prices.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why might the same stock have different prices in regular hours vs after-hours?
    - What is the biggest risk of trading when fewer participants are active?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: ECNs, order rules, and execution trade-offs"
  summary: >
    Learn how extended-hours trading works through ECNs, why brokers often restrict order types,
    and how lower participation creates partial fills, wider spreads, and higher execution uncertainty.
  key_points:
    - Pre-market and after-hours trading occurs via electronic communication networks (ECNs).
    - Liquidity is usually lower, so limit orders are commonly required to control price.
    - Wider spreads and higher volatility are more common outside regular sessions.
    - Partial fills happen more often because fewer shares are available at each price level.
    - News (earnings, macro data) can move prices sharply when liquidity is thin.
    - Good execution is harder: you trade earlier access for higher execution risk.
  subtopics:
    - What ECNs do (matching buyers/sellers outside the main session)
    - Why many brokers limit orders in extended hours (price control)
    - Partial fills and “thin book” behavior
    - Volatility around scheduled events (earnings, economic releases)
    - Practical decision: wait for regular hours vs trade early
  examples:
    - Liquidity example: >
        A limit order placed during pre-market hours fills only partially due to limited participation.
        Highlights the trade-off between early access and execution certainty.
    - "Order-type trade-off example: You want to buy after-hours on an earnings spike. A limit order can protect you from chasing an unstable price, but it may never fill if the price moves away."
  common_mistakes:
    - Setting a limit price too far from the market and assuming it will fill quickly.
    - Ignoring partial fill risk and ending up with an unintended position size.
    - Overreacting to an after-hours move that reverses once regular liquidity returns.
  questions_to_think:
    - When might extended hours trading be appropriate?
    - How do spreads affect execution during low-liquidity periods?
    - What is the main trade-off between early access and execution certainty?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Overnight trading, price discovery, and risk management"
  summary: >
    Learn how overnight/24-hour access (broker-dependent) changes price discovery, why off-hours moves can be noisy,
    and how to manage risk using session-aware order sizing, limits, and timing.
  key_points:
    - Overnight trading is broker-dependent and varies by market structure and product.
    - Off-hours price discovery can be less reliable because fewer participants set the price.
    - Wider spreads and thinner depth increase slippage risk and execution uncertainty.
    - Volatility regimes matter: stress periods can cause liquidity to vanish outside regular hours.
    - Risk controls (smaller size, limit orders, staged entries/exits) matter more in thin sessions.
    - For many investors, waiting for regular hours can improve execution quality and reduce hidden costs.
  subtopics:
    - Overnight sessions: what “broker-dependent” implies (availability and constraints)
    - Price discovery quality: why off-hours moves can reverse
    - Session-aware execution planning: sizing, limits, and patience
    - Event risk: earnings, macro releases, and global market spillovers
    - When not trading is the best execution strategy
  examples:
    - "Reversal example: A stock jumps after-hours on earnings, then gives back the move after analysts revise expectations and full liquidity returns at the open."
    - "Risk-control example: Instead of buying a full position after-hours, an investor buys a small starter position with a limit order and waits for regular hours to complete the trade with tighter spreads."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating off-hours prices as equally “true” as regular-session prices.
    - Trading full size in thin sessions and paying high spreads/slippage.
    - Assuming liquidity will be there when you need to exit quickly during stress.
  questions_to_think:
    - What signs would tell you off-hours liquidity is too thin to trade safely?
    - How would you change your order size and order type outside regular hours?

why_study_this:
  - Helps investors avoid unexpected price moves and poor execution.
  - Explains why prices may differ significantly between sessions.
  - Supports informed decisions about timing and order type.
