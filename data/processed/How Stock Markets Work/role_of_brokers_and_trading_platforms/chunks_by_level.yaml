title: What Is a Broker?
summary: >
  This lesson explains the role of brokers as intermediaries between investors and financial markets.
  It covers different broker types, how they earn revenue, the services they provide, and the regulatory
  responsibilities they carry, helping investors understand how trades are routed and executed.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: What a broker does (your gateway to the market)"
  summary: >
    Learn what a broker is, why you need one to trade on exchanges, and what you actually get when you use
    a brokerage app. You’ll also learn the basic difference between brokers and advisors.
  key_points:
    - A broker is an intermediary that helps you buy and sell securities on markets you can’t access directly.
    - Broker platforms provide tools to place orders, see prices, and track holdings.
    - Discount brokers mainly execute trades; full-service brokers may also provide advice and research.
    - Brokers make money through commissions, fees, or assets under management (AUM).
    - Your costs include more than commissions: spreads and execution quality matter too.
    - Brokers and financial advisors are not always the same role; “advice” can have different standards.
  subtopics:
    - Why you typically can’t trade directly on an exchange
    - What a brokerage account is (high-level)
    - Discount vs full-service brokers (simple comparison)
    - How brokers earn money (commissions, fees, AUM)
    - Broker vs advisor: execution vs advice (basic distinction)
  examples:
    - Broker type example: >
        A retail investor uses a discount broker app to place a limit order without receiving investment advice.
        Lower costs improve long-term returns, but responsibility for decision-making rests entirely with the investor.
    - "Platform tools example: A broker app lets you set a limit order, view bid/ask quotes, and see your portfolio performance in one place."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming “commission-free” means “free” (execution quality and spreads still matter).
    - Confusing a broker (trade execution) with a financial advisor (ongoing advice).
    - Picking a broker based only on the app UI and ignoring fees, protections, and execution.
  questions_to_think:
    - If a broker charges no commission, what other costs might you still pay?
    - What’s the difference between using a broker for execution and paying for advice?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: Broker types, incentives, and trade routing"
  summary: >
    Learn how different broker business models affect your outcomes. You’ll connect broker incentives to
    costs like execution quality, and understand how orders get routed to venues for filling.
  key_points:
    - Brokers can be agency brokers (execute for clients) or may route orders to other firms/venues for execution.
    - Business models shape incentives: commissions, subscription fees, AUM fees, interest on cash, and other revenue sources.
    - Execution quality can matter as much as explicit fees, especially in fast or illiquid markets.
    - Large orders may be split into smaller trades to reduce market impact and improve average execution.
    - Understanding broker incentives helps investors evaluate conflicts of interest and total trading costs.
  subtopics:
    - Agency broker concept vs broker routing (high-level)
    - How orders reach the market: routing and execution (conceptual)
    - Total cost of trading: commissions + spread + slippage (high-level)
    - Order handling for large trades (splitting/chunking concept)
    - What to look for: transparency, reporting, and pricing
  examples:
    - Trade execution example: >
        A high-net-worth investor places a large order through a broker, who breaks it into smaller trades
        to reduce market impact.
        Improves execution price and minimizes visible disruption to the order book.
    - "Execution vs fees example: Two brokers charge the same commission, but one regularly fills closer to the mid-price in liquid stocks—meaning lower hidden cost over time."
  common_mistakes:
    - Comparing brokers only by commission and ignoring execution quality.
    - Assuming all brokers route orders the same way.
    - Using market orders in thin liquidity and blaming the broker for predictable slippage.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why is trade execution quality as important as commission costs?
    - What information would you want from a broker to judge whether it is giving you good execution?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Regulation, investor protection, and conflicts of interest"
  summary: >
    Learn the regulatory responsibilities brokers carry and how investor protections work in practice.
    You’ll understand KYC, suitability/fiduciary concepts, and how conflicts of interest can appear depending
    on whether the broker is providing advice or only execution.
  key_points:
    - Brokers must follow KYC rules to verify identity and assess risk appropriateness for certain products.
    - Standards differ depending on whether the service is execution-only or includes investment advice.
    - Conflicts of interest can arise from how brokers are compensated; understanding incentives improves decision-making.
    - Regulatory oversight exists to protect investors and promote fair, transparent markets (jurisdiction-dependent).
    - Execution quality reporting and disclosures help investors evaluate whether a broker’s practices align with client interests.
    - The term “broker” can also apply in real estate, but the regulatory framework and duties differ from securities brokers.
  subtopics:
    - KYC and product access controls (why brokers ask questions)
    - Fiduciary vs non-fiduciary contexts (conceptual)
    - Conflicts of interest: compensation-driven behavior (high-level)
    - Oversight and investor protections (high-level; varies by country)
    - Securities brokers vs real estate brokers (why the term overlaps)
  examples:
    - Regulatory example: >
        A broker verifies a client’s identity and risk profile before allowing derivatives trading.
        Protects investors from inappropriate risk exposure and supports market integrity.
    - "Advice vs execution example: A full-service broker recommends a product and charges an ongoing fee (AUM). This creates different incentives than a discount broker that only executes trades."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming “regulated” means “no conflicts exist.”
    - Believing all brokers must act as fiduciaries in every interaction (standards depend on service type and jurisdiction).
    - Mixing up real estate broker rules with securities broker rules.
  questions_to_think:
    - How does a broker’s business model affect investor outcomes?
    - When might a full-service broker be preferable to a discount broker?
    - What protections would you want a broker to provide before letting you trade high-risk products?
