title: "Major Market Indices: S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones"
summary: >
  This lesson explains what major market indices are, how they are constructed, and why they are widely used
  as benchmarks for market performance. It focuses on the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average,
  highlighting their differences in weighting, sector exposure, and relevance to investors.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: What an index is (and why headlines talk about them)"
  summary: >
    Learn what market indices measure, why they’re used as “the market” shorthand, and the basic differences
    between the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones. You’ll also learn what daily index moves actually mean.
  key_points:
    - A market index tracks a selected group of stocks to represent a market segment.
    - Indices are benchmarks: they help you compare your portfolio or fund to “the market.”
    - The S&P 500 is often treated as a broad U.S. large-cap proxy.
    - The Nasdaq Composite includes many tech and growth companies, so it can move more sharply.
    - The Dow tracks 30 major companies and is often quoted in headlines, but it’s constructed differently.
    - Index moves are reported as both point change and percentage change—percentage usually matters more.
    - Indices are the building blocks for index funds and ETFs (passive investing).
  subtopics:
    - Index vs individual stock: what is being measured
    - “Point change” vs “percentage change”
    - Quick profiles: S&P 500 vs Nasdaq Composite vs Dow
    - Why investors use benchmarks
    - Why indices are used for market headlines
  examples:
    - "Headline interpretation example: The Dow is up 300 points. If that is only ~0.9%, it may be a normal daily move rather than a major event."
    - "Benchmark idea example: If your diversified U.S. stock portfolio rose 5% this year and the S&P 500 rose 10%, you likely lagged the benchmark."
  common_mistakes:
    - Confusing point change with percentage change.
    - Assuming “the market is up” means every stock is up.
    - Treating the Dow as the best representation of the entire stock market.
  questions_to_think:
    - If an index is up 1%, what does that actually mean for the average investor?
    - Why might two indices move differently on the same day?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: Construction and weighting—why these indices behave differently"
  summary: >
    Learn how index construction and weighting methods change index behavior. You’ll connect sector exposure
    and weighting (market-cap vs price-weighted) to differences in volatility, concentration, and performance.
  key_points:
    - Index construction (which stocks are included) strongly shapes performance and risk.
    - Weighting determines which stocks “move” the index the most.
    - The S&P 500 is market-cap-weighted, so mega-caps have outsized influence.
    - The Nasdaq Composite has a heavy technology/growth tilt, increasing cycle sensitivity.
    - The Dow is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks influence the index more, even if they’re smaller by market value.
    - Sector concentration can make an index outperform in some cycles and underperform in others.
    - Understanding composition prevents false assumptions about what “the market” represents.
  subtopics:
    - Market-cap-weighted vs price-weighted (intuitive explanation)
    - Concentration risk: when a few stocks dominate returns
    - Sector exposure: why Nasdaq is often more volatile
    - Benchmark selection: matching the benchmark to your portfolio style
    - Why “diversified” can mean different things across indices
  examples:
    - S&P 500 benchmark example: >
        A diversified equity portfolio delivers a 9% annual return while the S&P 500 returns 11% over the same period.
        Investors can assess whether underperformance is due to market conditions or portfolio construction choices.
    - Nasdaq volatility example: >
        During a technology sell-off, the Nasdaq declines more sharply than the S&P 500.
        Highlights higher growth exposure and volatility, helping investors align index exposure with risk tolerance.
    - Dow Jones weighting example: >
        A high-priced Dow component rises significantly, moving the index despite representing a smaller company by market value.
        Demonstrates how price-weighted indices can behave differently from market-cap-weighted indices.
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming all indices weight companies the same way.
    - Thinking Nasdaq performance represents the whole economy.
    - Comparing a portfolio to the wrong benchmark (e.g., tech-heavy portfolio vs S&P 500 without adjustment).
  questions_to_think:
    - Why might the Nasdaq outperform or underperform other indices during different market cycles?
    - What benchmark would you choose for a portfolio focused on large U.S. companies—and why?
    - How does price-weighting change what the Dow represents?

  title: "Advanced: Indices as products—ETFs, passive strategies, and interpretation pitfalls"
  summary: >
    Learn how indices are used in real investing products (ETFs, mutual funds) and how to interpret index moves
    more accurately using weighting effects, breadth, and concentration. You’ll also learn how index choice affects
    passive investing outcomes.
  key_points:
    - Indices are investable through ETFs and index funds; index design affects real-world returns and risk.
    - Concentration effects mean a small number of stocks can drive index returns, especially in market-cap-weighted indices.
    - “Index up” can hide weak breadth (few winners, many losers), which changes how you interpret market strength.
    - Index selection is a strategy choice: broad market exposure vs sector-tilted exposure.
    - Passive strategies depend on index rules; different indices can produce different “passive” outcomes.
    - Comparing performance should consider fees, tracking error, and the benchmark’s true exposure.
  subtopics:
    - Indices as foundations for ETFs and mutual funds
    - Breadth vs concentration (conceptual)
    - When “the market” headline is misleading
    - Choosing an index exposure: risk tolerance and time horizon fit
    - Practical benchmarking: matching portfolio style to the right index
  examples:
    - "Concentration example: The S&P 500 is up mainly because a few mega-caps rallied, while many smaller constituents were flat—suggesting less broad-based strength than the headline implies."
    - "Passive choice example: An investor picks a Nasdaq-focused ETF for long-term growth. They should expect higher drawdowns in tech-led sell-offs compared to a broader S&P 500 ETF."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming passive investing is identical across all indices.
    - Overreacting to point moves instead of percentage moves and context.
    - Ignoring concentration risk when using a single index as “the market.”
  questions_to_think:
    - How does index construction affect passive investing strategies?
    - Which index best reflects your personal investment goals—and why?
    - What risks come from using a tech-heavy index as your main benchmark?
