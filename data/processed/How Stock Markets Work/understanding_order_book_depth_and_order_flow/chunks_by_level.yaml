title: The Importance of Order Book Depth in Day Trading
summary: >
  This lesson explains how order book depth reveals liquidity, market sentiment,
  and short-term price dynamics. It shows how traders use bid and ask data,
  order sizes, and order flow to make informed intraday decisions while managing risk.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: What order book depth shows (liquidity and risk in real time)"
  summary: >
    Learn what “depth” means, how bid/ask levels reflect liquidity, and why thin books can make prices jump.
    The focus is not on “predicting the market,” but on understanding execution risk and short-term volatility.
  key_points:
    - Order book depth shows liquidity available at multiple price levels, not just the best bid/ask.
    - More depth usually means trades fill more smoothly with less slippage.
    - Thin order books amplify price movements because small trades can move through multiple levels.
    - Large clusters of bids or asks can suggest temporary support or resistance, not guarantees.
    - Depth links directly to volatility and execution risk, especially for intraday trading.
  subtopics:
    - Bid vs ask: what they represent
    - Depth vs top-of-book: why multiple levels matter
    - Thick vs thin books: what changes for traders
    - Basic support/resistance as “pressure zones,” not magic lines
    - Execution risk: slippage and partial fills (simple intuition)
  examples:
    - Support level example: >
        A stock shows large buy orders clustered at $99 and $100.
        Traders may view these levels as temporary support, influencing entry and stop placement.
    - Thin liquidity example: >
        A small sell order causes a sharp price drop due to limited depth.
        Demonstrates increased risk in low-liquidity environments.
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating order book signals as guarantees.
    - Assuming a large order on the book must be “real” and will always hold.
    - Ignoring that depth changes quickly and can vanish during fast markets.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why does deeper liquidity usually reduce slippage?
    - Why can a thin book make a stock feel “jumpy” even without big news?

  title: "Intermediate: Order flow, short-term pressure, and session effects"
  summary: >
    Learn how traders interpret order flow (the movement of buys/sells over time), why depth shifts around the open/close,
    and how news can rapidly change liquidity. The goal is to connect depth + flow to risk management decisions.
  key_points:
    - Order flow reflects short-term buying vs selling pressure and can change quickly.
    - Depth often fluctuates around market open/close when participation and volatility shift.
    - News events can cause liquidity withdrawal, widening spreads and reducing depth.
    - Large bid/ask clusters can attract trader attention and influence short-term behavior.
    - Thin markets increase the chance of stop-loss slippage and unexpected fills.
    - Depth analysis is best paired with context (trend, volatility, news), not used alone.
  subtopics:
    - Order flow vs static depth: what “pressure” means
    - Liquidity around open/close: why conditions change
    - News and liquidity withdrawal: why the book can “disappear”
    - Stops in thin markets: why risk management gets harder
    - Practical read: when not to trade due to poor depth
  examples:
    - "Open volatility example: At the open, depth reshuffles and spreads widen briefly. A market order may get a worse fill than expected compared to a few minutes later."
    - "News shock example: A headline hits, market makers pull quotes, and visible depth drops. Price moves faster because fewer resting orders absorb trades."
  common_mistakes:
    - Overreacting to one moment of order flow without confirming context.
    - Trading aggressively at the open without accounting for wider spreads and unstable depth.
    - Placing tight stops in thin conditions and getting stopped out by noise/slippage.
  questions_to_think:
    - How does order book depth change around market open?
    - What clues might tell you liquidity is being pulled before a fast move?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Strategy mapping—scalping, momentum, reversals (and their failure modes)"
  summary: >
    Learn how depth and order flow are used in common intraday styles (scalping, momentum, reversal),
    and why these strategies are fragile when liquidity regimes change. The emphasis is on disciplined execution and risk control.
  key_points:
    - Scalping depends on stable spreads and consistent depth; it breaks when liquidity thins or spreads widen.
    - Momentum trading benefits when order flow aligns with trend, but is vulnerable to sudden liquidity withdrawal.
    - Reversal strategies often look for exhaustion in order flow near perceived support/resistance, but can fail during news-driven moves.
    - Depth “signals” can be spoofed or canceled; reliability depends on market conditions and participant behavior.
    - Risk management must account for worst-case execution (slippage) when the book is thin.
    - Strategy selection should match liquidity regime: calm, trending, or volatile/news-driven.
  subtopics:
    - Scalping: capturing small moves; spread and fee sensitivity
    - Momentum: flow-following vs chasing; when momentum dies
    - Reversals: absorption/exhaustion concepts (high-level)
    - Failure modes: spoofing, cancellations, and regime shifts
    - Execution discipline: sizing, stop placement, and avoiding thin conditions
  examples:
    - Scalping example: >
        A trader exploits a brief liquidity gap to capture a small price movement.
        Highlights how order book depth enables short-term strategies but requires speed and discipline.
    - "Momentum failure example: A trader buys a breakout seeing strong bids, but bids vanish after a headline. Price snaps back because liquidity was not stable."
    - "Reversal failure example: A trader fades a move into a big ask wall, but the wall is pulled and price continues higher—showing why resting orders are not guarantees."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating support/resistance from the book as fixed levels rather than temporary liquidity zones.
    - Assuming visible depth cannot disappear or be canceled.
    - Using the same strategy in every regime (calm vs news vs open/close) and blaming “bad luck.”
  questions_to_think:
    - Why can small orders cause large moves in thin markets?
    - Which strategy (scalping, momentum, reversal) is most sensitive to spread widening—and why?
    - How would you change trade sizing when depth is unstable?
