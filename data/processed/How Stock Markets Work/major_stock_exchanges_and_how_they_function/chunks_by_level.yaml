title: What Are Stock Exchanges?
summary: >
  This lesson introduces stock exchanges as the core infrastructure of financial markets.
  It explains how exchanges enable capital formation, facilitate trading, and support price discovery,
  while distinguishing between primary and secondary markets and different exchange structures.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: What an exchange does (the market’s marketplace)"
  summary: >
    Learn what stock exchanges are, why companies list on them, and how everyday investors trade shares.
    You’ll understand the difference between primary vs secondary markets and why exchanges matter for trust and transparency.
  key_points:
    - A stock exchange is an organized marketplace where buyers and sellers trade shares.
    - Exchanges make trading easier by standardizing rules, prices, and processes.
    - Companies raise money in the primary market (e.g., IPO); investors trade shares in the secondary market.
    - Exchanges support price discovery: prices update as supply and demand change.
    - Listing standards and regulation help investors trust the market more than informal trading.
    - Exchanges matter even to long-term investors because they influence liquidity and transaction costs.
  subtopics:
    - What a stock exchange is (in plain language)
    - Why companies list shares (raising capital)
    - Primary vs secondary markets (IPO vs everyday trading)
    - Price discovery: why prices move
    - Why rules and oversight matter for investor confidence
  examples:
    - IPO example: >
        A private company lists its shares on a major exchange, offering them to the public for the first time.
        Investors gain early access to a growing business, while the company raises capital for expansion.
    - Secondary market example: >
        An investor buys shares of a well-known company from another investor on an exchange.
        Liquidity allows investors to enter or exit positions easily without affecting company operations.
  common_mistakes:
    - Confusing buying in an IPO (primary market) with buying on the exchange afterward (secondary market).
    - Thinking exchanges only matter to day traders (they affect every investor’s costs and liquidity).
    - Assuming exchange prices are “set by the company” rather than by supply and demand.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why does a company benefit from listing on a major exchange?
    - What is the biggest difference between primary and secondary markets?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: How exchanges run trading (liquidity, spreads, and mechanisms)"
  summary: >
    Learn how exchanges actually match orders, how liquidity is created, and why spreads exist.
    You’ll connect market makers, auctions, and electronic trading to real investor outcomes like execution quality.
  key_points:
    - Modern exchanges use electronic systems and matching engines to handle high-volume trading.
    - Liquidity (how easily you can trade) affects spreads, slippage, and execution reliability.
    - The bid–ask spread is a price difference driven by supply/demand and liquidity, not a direct “exchange fee.”
    - Market makers and other liquidity providers quote buys/sells to reduce friction and support continuous trading.
    - Exchanges can use auctions (e.g., opening/closing auctions) and continuous trading to form prices.
    - Understanding exchange mechanics helps investors choose order types and avoid costly execution mistakes.
  subtopics:
    - Electronic exchanges and matching engines (high-level)
    - Bid/ask, spreads, and what they signal about liquidity
    - Market makers and liquidity provision
    - Auctions vs continuous trading (opening/closing auctions concept)
    - Execution quality: why the same order can fill differently in different conditions
  examples:
    - Market maker example: >
        A market maker continuously quotes buy and sell prices for a stock.
        Reduces trading friction and improves execution reliability, especially during volatile periods.
    - "Spread and liquidity example: A small stock has a wide bid–ask spread and thin trading volume. A market order is more likely to experience slippage than in a highly liquid large-cap stock."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating the bid–ask spread as a broker fee instead of a market price difference.
    - Ignoring liquidity conditions when placing market orders.
    - Viewing exchanges as passive venues rather than systems that shape execution outcomes.
  questions_to_think:
    - What is the role of market makers in maintaining liquidity?
    - How does a wider bid–ask spread change your trading cost?

  title: "Advanced: Exchange structures, auctions, and risks beyond major exchanges"
  summary: >
    Learn how different exchange models and market structures affect price formation, regulation, and risk.
    You’ll compare auction-based vs electronic models, understand why closing auctions matter, and identify the risks in OTC or lightly regulated venues.
  key_points:
    - Auction mechanisms (especially open/close) concentrate liquidity and help establish widely referenced prices.
    - Exchange structure (auction-based vs fully electronic) affects transparency, execution, and volatility behavior.
    - Different exchange models serve different company sizes and regulatory needs (major listings vs smaller venues).
    - Less regulated or OTC venues can have wider spreads, lower liquidity, and higher information risk.
    - Market structure influences liquidity quality and how prices respond during stress.
    - Knowing venue risk helps investors avoid false confidence when trading thin or lightly regulated securities.
  subtopics:
    - NYSE-style opening/closing auctions (conceptual overview)
    - Auction-based vs electronic exchanges (trade-offs)
    - Listing standards and why they exist (investor protection and credibility)
    - OTC markets: what they are and why risks increase
    - Liquidity and price discovery during volatility (high-level)
  examples:
    - "Closing auction example: Many large funds execute near the close to match benchmark pricing, concentrating orders into the closing auction and making the closing price especially important."
    - "OTC risk example: A lightly regulated OTC stock shows sporadic trading and wide spreads. Even small orders can move the price significantly, increasing execution and manipulation risk."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming all trading venues provide the same transparency and investor protections.
    - Believing “a quoted price” guarantees you can trade meaningful size at that price.
    - Underestimating OTC risks (liquidity, spreads, and price reliability).
  questions_to_think:
    - How does the NYSE closing auction determine stock prices?
    - What are the key differences between auction-based and electronic exchanges?
    - What risks exist in less regulated or OTC markets?
