title: Risk Measures
summary: >
  Risk measures are quantitative tools used to evaluate the uncertainty, volatility, and potential downside of investments.
  They help investors understand not just how much an asset can return, but how risky those returns are relative to benchmarks,
  the broader market, and alternative investments. This lesson explains the most common risk measures—alpha, beta, R-squared,
  standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, and Value at Risk (VaR)—and shows how they work together to support better portfolio
  construction and risk management.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: Risk isn’t just “can I lose money?”—it’s how returns behave"
  summary: >
    Learn why risk measures exist: returns can be high but unstable, or steady but lower. You’ll understand the big idea
    behind each metric and what question it answers (volatility, market sensitivity, or downside loss).
  key_points:
    - Risk measures quantify different dimensions of investment risk, such as volatility, market sensitivity, and downside potential.
    - They let investors compare investments on a risk-adjusted basis, not returns alone.
    - Standard deviation is a common proxy for volatility: how widely returns swing around the average.
    - Beta describes market sensitivity: how much an asset tends to move when the market moves.
    - Sharpe ratio is a “return per unit of risk” concept (higher can be better, all else equal).
    - VaR focuses on downside risk by estimating a loss threshold under normal conditions.
    - No single measure is enough; use a set of metrics for a fuller picture.
  subtopics:
    - Risk vs return: why you can’t judge performance by return alone
    - Volatility (standard deviation) in plain language
    - Market sensitivity (beta) in plain language
    - Risk-adjusted return (Sharpe) in plain language
    - Downside estimates (VaR) in plain language
  examples:
    - Standard deviation example: >
        Two funds have the same average return, but one shows much wider fluctuations in monthly returns.
        The fund with higher standard deviation is riskier, even if long-term returns appear similar.
    - Beta example: >
        A stock with a beta of 1.4 tends to move 40% more than the overall market.
        The stock may outperform strongly in rising markets but also experience larger losses during downturns.
  common_mistakes:
    - Evaluating investments based only on returns without considering risk measures.
    - Assuming “higher return” always means “better” regardless of volatility and drawdowns.
    - Thinking volatility is the only kind of risk (liquidity and extreme events exist too).
  questions_to_think:
    - Why is it important to consider both risk and return when comparing investments?
    - How do beta and standard deviation measure different types of risk?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: Alpha, beta, R-squared—skill vs exposure (and whether it’s meaningful)"
  summary: >
    Learn how alpha and beta relate to a benchmark, and why R-squared is the “quality check” that tells you whether those
    numbers are actually meaningful. You’ll connect manager skill vs market exposure in a practical way.
  key_points:
    - Alpha measures excess return relative to a benchmark after accounting for market exposure.
    - Beta measures sensitivity to benchmark/market movements (systematic risk).
    - R-squared measures how closely performance tracks the benchmark, indicating how meaningful beta and alpha are.
    - High R-squared suggests the benchmark explains most movement, making beta/alpha more interpretable.
    - Low R-squared means the benchmark isn’t explaining much, so alpha/beta can be misleading.
    - Risk measures help compare funds that look similar on returns but differ in “how” they earned them.
  subtopics:
    - Benchmark selection: why the benchmark must match the strategy
    - Alpha: “did you add value beyond the market?”
    - Beta: “how market-driven are your returns?”
    - R-squared: “does this benchmark actually explain the returns?”
    - Practical interpretation: passive-like vs truly active behavior
  examples:
    - Alpha example: >
        A mutual fund earns 9% in a year while its benchmark index returns 7%, after adjusting for market exposure.
        A positive alpha of 2% suggests the fund added value beyond market movements, potentially indicating skill or an effective strategy.
    - R-squared example: >
        A fund has an R-squared of 95 when compared to its benchmark index.
        The fund closely tracks the benchmark, making its alpha and beta more meaningful and reliable.
  common_mistakes:
    - Interpreting beta without checking R-squared, which can make beta misleading.
    - Treating alpha as permanent rather than potentially temporary or market-dependent.
    - Using the wrong benchmark (creating “fake” alpha or meaningless beta).
  questions_to_think:
    - Why does a low R-squared limit the usefulness of alpha and beta?
    - If a fund has high R-squared and beta near 1, what does that suggest about its behavior?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Sharpe, VaR, and what risk metrics miss (tail risk and regime changes)"
  summary: >
    Learn how risk-adjusted metrics and downside estimates are used in portfolio construction, and where they can fail.
    You’ll understand why VaR can underestimate extreme events and why combining metrics is essential.
  key_points:
    - The Sharpe ratio combines return and risk to show excess return earned per unit of volatility.
    - Sharpe can be distorted by non-normal returns, illiquidity, or strategies with “hidden” tail risk.
    - Value at Risk (VaR) estimates a loss threshold at a confidence level, but assumes “normal conditions.”
    - VaR can underestimate risk during crises, structural breaks, or fat-tail events.
    - Standard deviation doesn’t capture the shape of losses (skewness) or extreme downside well.
    - Portfolio construction improves when you interpret metrics together and stress-test assumptions.
    - Investors should connect metrics to real decisions: position sizing, diversification, and risk limits.
  subtopics:
    - Sharpe ratio: what it rewards and what it ignores
    - VaR: confidence levels, time horizons, and interpretation
    - Tail risk and “fat tails” (conceptual): why extremes happen more than models expect
    - Regime changes: why correlations and volatility can shift suddenly
    - Using multiple metrics together for diversification and risk control
  examples:
    - Sharpe ratio example: >
        Fund A has a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, while Fund B has a Sharpe ratio of 0.6.
        Fund A delivers more return per unit of risk, making it more attractive for risk-adjusted performance.
    - VaR example: >
        A portfolio has a one-day VaR of $1,000 at a 95% confidence level.
        Under normal conditions, daily losses are expected to exceed $1,000 only 5% of the time.
    - "VaR failure example: In a crisis, markets gap and correlations spike. Losses can exceed VaR far more than expected because conditions are no longer “normal.”"
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming standard deviation captures all types of risk, including extreme events.
    - Treating VaR as a worst-case loss (it is not).
    - Using a single risk metric instead of a combination.
    - Comparing Sharpe ratios across strategies with very different return distributions without context.
  questions_to_think:
    - In what situations might VaR underestimate true risk?
    - How can risk measures improve portfolio diversification decisions?
    - If two funds have similar returns, what combination of metrics would you check first—and why?
