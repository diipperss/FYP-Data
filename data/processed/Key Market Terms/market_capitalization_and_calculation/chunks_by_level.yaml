title: Market Capitalization and Calculation
summary: >
  Market capitalization, or market cap, represents the total market value of a company’s equity and is one of the most widely used measures of company size.
  It helps investors classify companies, assess risk profiles, and align investments with growth or stability objectives.
  This lesson explains how market cap is calculated, how it changes, and why it differs from other valuation measures.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: Market cap = price × shares (size of the company’s equity)"
  summary: >
    Learn what market cap is and how to calculate it. You’ll understand why share price alone is meaningless for company size,
    and how market cap gives a clearer “how big is it?” view.
  key_points:
    - Market cap is calculated as share price multiplied by shares outstanding.
    - Market cap represents equity value (the value of all shares combined), not the whole business.
    - Share price alone does not tell you company size.
    - If price changes, market cap changes; if share count changes, market cap changes.
    - Market cap is commonly used to compare companies and classify them by size.
  subtopics:
    - The market cap formula (simple)
    - Why “$10 stock” can be bigger than “$500 stock”
    - How market cap changes: price moves vs share count moves
    - Equity value vs “company value” (intro)
  examples:
    - Basic calculation example: >
        A company with 1 million shares outstanding trading at $10 per share.
        The market cap is $10 million, classifying it as a small-cap company.
    - Comparison example: >
        Two companies have the same stock price, but one has ten times more shares outstanding.
        The company with more shares has a much larger market cap and is typically less volatile.
  common_mistakes:
    - Judging a company's size solely by its stock price rather than considering market cap.
    - Thinking market cap is the amount of money invested in the company (it’s a market value, not a cash pile).
  questions_to_think:
    - If a company doubles its share price but share count stays the same, what happens to market cap?
    - Why can a high-priced stock belong to a smaller company?

  title: "Intermediate: Market cap categories, portfolio use, and dilution effects"
  summary: >
    Learn how investors use market cap to build diversified portfolios and infer typical risk profiles.
    You’ll also connect market cap to share issuance and dilution so you don’t get tricked by changes in share count.
  key_points:
    - Market cap categorizes companies into mega-cap, large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and nano-cap.
    - Investors use market cap to compare companies and construct diversified portfolios.
    - Changes in share price or share count directly affect market cap.
    - Share issuance can increase market cap even if the stock price doesn’t change.
    - Market cap can hint at typical risk/volatility patterns (smaller caps often swing more), but it’s not a rule.
  subtopics:
    - Market cap “buckets” and what they loosely imply
    - Diversification across caps: growth potential vs stability trade-offs (high-level)
    - Share issuance and dilution: why “bigger market cap” isn’t always “better per share”
    - Float vs total shares (intro)
  examples:
    - Share issuance example: >
        A company issues additional shares while its stock price remains unchanged.
        Market cap increases even though individual share value does not.
    - "Diversification example: An investor holds large-caps for stability and adds some small-caps for higher growth potential and higher risk."
  common_mistakes:
    - Ignoring dilution effects from share issuance.
    - Assuming small-cap automatically means “better upside” without considering business quality and liquidity.
    - Treating market cap categories as strict labels rather than ranges that can shift with price.
  questions_to_think:
    - How does market capitalization influence investment strategies?
    - If a company issues many new shares, how can that affect existing shareholders even if market cap rises?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Market cap vs enterprise value, float, and what market cap doesn’t tell you"
  summary: >
    Learn why market cap is only the equity piece and when enterprise value (EV) gives a better picture of the whole business.
    You’ll also understand float and why two companies with the same market cap can have very different risk and tradability.
  key_points:
    - Market cap measures equity value only and does not include debt or cash.
    - Enterprise value is a broader measure: market cap + debt − cash (high-level).
    - EV can be more informative when comparing companies with different leverage or cash balances.
    - Float (tradable shares) affects liquidity and volatility; market cap alone doesn’t capture tradability.
    - Market cap doesn’t directly tell you valuation “cheap vs expensive” without fundamentals (earnings, cash flow, growth).
  subtopics:
    - Why debt matters: two companies, same market cap, different balance sheets
    - Enterprise value as “price tag for the whole business” (conceptual)
    - Float vs outstanding shares: liquidity implications
    - Connecting to valuation: market cap is not a value judgment by itself
    - Corporate actions and capital structure changes (high-level link)
  examples:
    - "EV comparison example: Two firms both have $10B market cap. One has $8B debt and little cash; the other has $1B debt and lots of cash. Their enterprise values (and risk profiles) can be very different."
    - "Float example: A company has a large market cap but a small public float because insiders hold most shares, which can increase volatility and widen spreads."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating market cap as the same as enterprise value or total business value.
    - Comparing market caps across companies without considering debt, cash, and float differences.
    - Assuming market cap predicts returns (it mainly describes size and equity value).
  questions_to_think:
    - When is enterprise value more informative than market cap?
    - How could a small float change trading costs and volatility even if market cap is large?
    - Why might two companies with the same market cap be very different investments?
