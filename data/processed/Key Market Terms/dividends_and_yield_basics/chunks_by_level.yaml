title: "Dividend Yield: What It Is and How to Calculate It"
summary: >
  Dividend yield measures the income an investor receives from dividends relative to a stock’s market price.
  It is a key metric for income-focused investors and provides insight into a company’s dividend policy, stability,
  and valuation. This lesson explains how dividend yield is calculated, what influences it, and how to interpret it
  alongside other financial ratios.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: Dividend yield = dividend income ÷ price"
  summary: >
    Learn what dividend yield means and how to calculate it. You’ll understand that dividend yield measures only dividend income
    (not total return) and that it can change just because the stock price changes.
  key_points:
    - Dividend yield shows the cash income return from dividends alone.
    - It is calculated as annual dividends per share divided by the current share price.
    - Dividend yield changes as the stock price fluctuates, even if dividends remain constant.
    - Dividend yield is not total return: price gains/losses matter too.
    - Dividend yield is most useful for comparing income potential across stocks or funds.
  subtopics:
    - Dividend yield formula (simple)
    - Annual dividend per share: where it comes from
    - Why yield moves when price moves
    - Dividend yield vs total return (income + price change)
  examples:
    - Basic calculation example: >
        A company pays $2 per share annually and trades at $40 per share.
        The dividend yield is 5%, providing a clear measure of income return.
    - Price movement example: >
        A stock’s price falls from $50 to $40 while the dividend remains $2.
        The yield rises from 4% to 5%, which may reflect higher risk rather than improved fundamentals.
  common_mistakes:
    - Confusing dividend yield with total return.
    - Using outdated dividend figures in calculations.
    - Assuming a higher yield automatically means a better investment.
  questions_to_think:
    - If a stock’s price drops but the dividend stays the same, what happens to dividend yield?
    - Why might a high yield look attractive but still be risky?

  title: "Intermediate: Interpreting yield—stability, payout ratio, and sector differences"
  summary: >
    Learn what dividend yield can signal about a company and why you must check sustainability.
    You’ll connect yield to payout ratios, earnings quality, and why some sectors naturally have higher yields.
  key_points:
    - Stable and growing dividends often indicate mature, financially healthy companies.
    - A high dividend yield can signal strong income or potential financial stress.
    - Dividend yield should be analyzed together with payout ratio and earnings sustainability.
    - Sector norms matter: some industries reinvest cash (lower yield) while others distribute more (higher yield).
    - Dividend policies vary; comparing yields without context can be misleading.
  subtopics:
    - Dividend stability vs dividend traps (conceptual)
    - Payout ratio: how much of earnings is paid out
    - Earnings and cash flow coverage (high-level)
    - Sector yield patterns: REITs/utilities vs tech
    - Dividend growth vs high yield (trade-off)
  examples:
    - Sector example: >
        REITs and utilities often show higher dividend yields than technology firms.
        These sectors may appeal more to income-focused investors than growth-oriented ones.
    - "Payout ratio warning example: A company has a 10% yield but is paying out nearly all earnings (or more). If profits fall, the dividend may be cut."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming the highest dividend yield always represents the best investment.
    - Ignoring dividend sustainability and cash flow coverage.
    - Comparing yields across sectors without considering business models.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why can a rising dividend yield sometimes be a warning sign?
    - Why should investors consider payout ratios alongside dividend yield?

  title: "Advanced: Yield, valuation, and interest rates (why dividend stocks react to macro)"
  summary: >
    Learn how dividend yield interacts with valuation and interest rates, and why dividend-focused assets can behave
    differently across market cycles. You’ll understand “rate sensitivity” and how to evaluate income alongside risk.
  key_points:
    - Dividend yield moves inversely with price, linking yield to valuation changes.
    - Dividend-paying stocks can be sensitive to interest rates because investors compare yields to bond yields.
    - When rates rise, high-dividend stocks may face pressure as safer yields become more competitive (conceptual).
    - High yield can reflect higher perceived risk (dividend cut risk), not just “cheapness.”
    - Total return framing matters: dividend income + price performance + reinvestment effects.
    - Investors should evaluate dividend policy, balance sheet strength, and cash flow durability alongside yield.
  subtopics:
    - Yield as a valuation signal (price-driven yield changes)
    - Interest rate sensitivity: why income assets can reprice
    - Dividend cut risk and market expectations
    - Total return and reinvestment: compounding dividends (conceptual)
    - Comparing dividend strategies: high yield vs dividend growth (conceptual)
  examples:
    - "Rate shift example: If treasury yields rise sharply, investors may demand higher yields from dividend stocks too, which can push stock prices down until yields look competitive."
    - "Total return example: Two stocks both yield 4%, but one grows earnings and dividends while the other is shrinking. The long-term outcome can be very different even with the same starting yield."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating dividend yield as a standalone “value” metric without checking fundamentals.
    - Ignoring rate regimes and assuming dividend stocks always behave defensively.
    - Chasing yield and getting hit by dividend cuts.
  questions_to_think:
    - How does dividend yield complement capital gains in total return?
    - How do interest rate changes affect dividend-paying stocks?
    - If a stock’s yield spikes suddenly, what fundamental questions should you ask first?
