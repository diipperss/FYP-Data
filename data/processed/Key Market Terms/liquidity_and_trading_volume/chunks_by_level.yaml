title: Volume vs Liquidity
summary: >
  Volume and liquidity are closely related but fundamentally different concepts in financial markets.
  Volume measures how many shares trade over a period of time, while liquidity describes how easily an asset can be bought
  or sold at or near its current market price without causing large price changes. This lesson clarifies the distinction,
  explains why liquidity matters more for most investors, and shows how tools like bid-ask spreads and order book depth
  provide better insight than volume alone.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: Volume = activity, Liquidity = how easy (and cheap) it is to trade"
  summary: >
    Learn the core difference: volume tells you how much trading happened; liquidity tells you whether you can trade quickly
    near the current price without paying a big spread or moving the price. For most investors, liquidity is the one that bites your wallet.
  key_points:
    - Volume measures trading activity (how many shares traded).
    - Liquidity measures ease and cost of trading near the current price.
    - Liquidity reflects how quickly an asset can be traded with minimal price impact.
    - Bid-ask spread is a clear real-time indicator of liquidity.
    - High volume often helps liquidity, but it does not guarantee it.
  subtopics:
    - What volume measures (count of shares/contracts)
    - What liquidity measures (tradability + cost)
    - “Cheap to trade” vs “popular to trade”
    - Bid-ask spread in simple terms
    - Why investors care: execution quality and slippage
  examples:
    - High liquidity example: >
        A large-cap stock trades millions of shares daily and consistently shows a narrow bid-ask spread.
        Investors can enter and exit positions quickly with minimal trading costs or price slippage.
    - Low volume example: >
        A micro-cap stock trades only a few thousand shares per day.
        Low liquidity increases execution risk, making it harder to buy or sell without moving the price.
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming high volume always implies high liquidity.
    - Treating low volume as poor performance rather than limited market participation.
    - Ignoring bid-ask spreads when assessing tradability.
  questions_to_think:
    - If you need to sell quickly, which matters more: yesterday’s volume or today’s spread?
    - Why can “active trading” still be expensive?

  summary: >
    Learn the practical tools that reveal liquidity better than volume: bid-ask spreads and order book depth.
    You’ll understand average daily volume (ADV) as an activity metric—and why it doesn’t directly tell you trading cost.
  key_points:
    - High volume does not always guarantee high liquidity.
    - Bid-ask spread reveals hidden trading costs in real time.
    - Order book depth shows how much buying/selling interest exists across multiple price levels.
    - Average daily volume (ADV) helps compare activity across time but does not capture trading costs.
    - Liquidity is about the ability to transact near the mid-price without large slippage.
  subtopics:
    - Spread as a cost: why tight spreads matter
    - Order book depth: why multiple levels matter
    - ADV: what it’s good for (and what it’s not)
    - Slippage and market impact (conceptual)
    - When volume spikes can still come with bad liquidity (news/volatility)
  examples:
    - Volume vs liquidity example: >
        Two stocks trade 500,000 shares per day, but one has a $0.01 spread while the other has a $0.30 spread.
        Despite similar volume, the stock with the tighter spread is far more liquid and cheaper to trade.
    - "News spike example: A stock’s volume surges on breaking news, but spreads widen and depth thins—so trading becomes more expensive despite higher activity."
  common_mistakes:
    - Using volume alone without considering order book depth.
    - Assuming spreads are stable across the day (they often widen at open/close and during volatility).
    - Equating “volume up” with “easy to trade now.”
  questions_to_think:
    - How can bid-ask spreads reveal hidden trading costs?
    - In what situations might volume be misleading as a liquidity signal?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Liquidity as a risk factor—execution quality, strategy fit, and microstructure"
  summary: >
    Learn how liquidity affects real outcomes: execution quality, stop-loss reliability, and whether a strategy is viable.
    You’ll connect volume/spread/depth to microstructure concepts like market impact and adverse selection.
  key_points:
    - Investors generally prioritize liquidity because it directly affects execution quality and risk.
    - Liquidity risk shows up as slippage, partial fills, and price impact—especially for larger orders.
    - Depth matters more than volume for large trades because it determines how far you must “walk the book.”
    - Strategies with frequent trading (day trading/scalping) are highly sensitive to spreads and depth, not just volume.
    - Liquidity can disappear during stress, making historical ADV a weak guide to worst-case execution.
    - A robust evaluation uses multiple signals together: spread + depth + volatility + session conditions.
  subtopics:
    - Execution quality: spread cost vs market impact
    - Depth and “walking the book” (conceptual link)
    - Stop-loss behavior in thin liquidity (gaps and slippage)
    - Liquidity regimes: calm vs volatile vs open/close
    - Practical checklist: when to avoid trading due to poor liquidity
  examples:
    - "Large order example: Two stocks have similar ADV, but one has shallow depth. A large market order in the shallow book moves through levels, producing worse average fills."
    - "Stress example: During a market shock, spreads widen and depth vanishes. Liquidity risk becomes the dominant risk even if the company fundamentals didn’t change."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating ADV as a guarantee of liquidity during volatile events.
    - Ignoring liquidity when sizing positions (position too big to exit safely).
    - Using market orders in thin books and being surprised by market impact.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why does liquidity matter more than volume when entering or exiting trades?
    - How would you judge whether an asset is tradable for your position size?
    - What signals would warn you that liquidity could vanish quickly?
