title: "Bid Ask Spread: How It Works and Why It Matters"
summary: >
  The bid-ask spread represents the gap between what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are willing to accept for a security.
  It is a direct trading cost and a key indicator of liquidity. This lesson explains how bid and ask prices are set, why spreads vary
  across securities, and how understanding the bid-ask spread can help investors trade more efficiently and reduce hidden costs.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: The spread is the price of getting a trade done now"
  summary: >
    Learn the basics: bid = what buyers pay, ask = what sellers want, and the spread is the gap between them.
    If you buy immediately, you usually buy at the ask; if you sell immediately, you usually sell at the bid—so the spread is a cost.
  key_points:
    - The bid price reflects demand, while the ask price reflects supply.
    - The bid-ask spread is the gap between bid and ask, and it’s an implicit transaction cost.
    - Buying immediately typically means paying the ask; selling immediately typically means accepting the bid.
    - Highly liquid securities usually have narrow spreads; less liquid ones have wider spreads.
    - The spread is part of “hidden trading costs” even when commissions are low or zero.
  subtopics:
    - Bid vs ask: what each means
    - Why the spread exists (buyers and sellers don’t agree on one price)
    - How you “pay” the spread when you trade
    - Liquidity in plain language: how easily you can trade without moving price
  examples:
    - Liquidity example: >
        A large-cap stock trades with a bid of $50.00 and an ask of $50.02.
        The narrow $0.02 spread indicates high liquidity and low trading costs.
    - Illiquidity example: >
        A small-cap stock trades with a bid of $9.50 and an ask of $10.10.
        The wide spread increases trading costs and makes entering or exiting positions more expensive.
  common_mistakes:
    - Buying at the ask or selling at the bid without recognizing the spread as a cost.
    - Ignoring spreads when trading less-liquid stocks or ETFs.
    - Thinking “commission-free” means “cost-free.”
  questions_to_think:
    - If you buy at the ask and immediately sell at the bid, what happens?
    - Why might a “cheap” stock still be expensive to trade?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: Why spreads widen (liquidity, volatility, and trading sessions)"
  summary: >
    Learn what makes spreads tighter or wider: how many participants are active, how risky the price is to quote,
    and when the market is most liquid. You’ll connect spreads to market conditions and execution quality.
  key_points:
    - Highly liquid securities typically have narrow spreads because many buyers and sellers compete.
    - Illiquid or volatile securities tend to have wider spreads due to higher execution and inventory risk.
    - Spreads often widen during market open/close and around major news because uncertainty increases.
    - ETFs can have tight spreads when underlying markets are liquid and trading volume is high.
    - Wider spreads disproportionately affect frequent traders because the cost compounds across many trades.
  subtopics:
    - Liquidity and competition: more orders = tighter spreads
    - Volatility and uncertainty: why quote risk increases spreads
    - Time-of-day effects: open/close and thin periods
    - ETF spreads: how popularity and underlying liquidity matter
    - Execution quality: why limit orders can reduce spread cost
  examples:
    - ETF example: >
        A popular index ETF trades with a consistently tight spread during market hours.
        Investors can buy or sell efficiently without sacrificing much value to transaction costs.
    - "Open/close example: A stock shows a $0.03 spread midday but $0.10 near the open when liquidity is reorganizing and volatility is higher."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming spreads are constant throughout the trading day.
    - Overtrading in wide-spread securities, reducing net returns.
    - Using market orders in thin liquidity and being surprised by worse fills.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why are spreads typically wider during market open and close?
    - How do spreads affect your choice between a market order and a limit order?

  title: "Advanced: Market makers, microstructure, and optimizing execution"
  summary: >
    Learn how market makers and liquidity providers quote prices, why spreads compensate them for risk,
    and how investors can reduce spread-related costs through better execution decisions.
  key_points:
    - Market makers facilitate trading by continuously quoting bid and ask prices.
    - The spread compensates market makers for providing liquidity and bearing risk (inventory + adverse selection).
    - Spread is a component of total transaction cost, alongside slippage and market impact.
    - Spread sensitivity is higher in small-caps, volatile names, and around events when liquidity can disappear.
    - Trading tactics (limit orders, patience, sizing, timing) can reduce effective spread costs.
    - Frequent strategies (day trading, scalping) are highly exposed to spread costs; small spreads matter a lot.
  subtopics:
    - Why market makers exist: immediacy and continuous quotes
    - Inventory risk and adverse selection (conceptual)
    - Total trading cost: spread + slippage + market impact (link to microstructure)
    - Execution tactics: limit orders, timing away from open/close, smaller sizes
    - When spread cost dominates strategy performance
  examples:
    - "Market maker compensation example: A market maker quotes $50.00/$50.02 and earns the spread (on average) for taking the risk of buying from sellers and selling to buyers."
    - "Execution tactic example: A trader uses a limit order near the mid-price and waits for a fill, reducing the effective spread paid compared to a market order—at the cost of fill uncertainty."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating the spread as a “fee” charged by the broker rather than a market pricing gap.
    - Ignoring how spreads interact with slippage and market impact for large orders.
    - Using tight stop orders in wide-spread markets and getting triggered by noise.
  questions_to_think:
    - How do bid-ask spreads affect long-term investors versus day traders?
    - What role do market makers play in reducing spreads?
    - When is paying the spread worth it (and when is it not)?
