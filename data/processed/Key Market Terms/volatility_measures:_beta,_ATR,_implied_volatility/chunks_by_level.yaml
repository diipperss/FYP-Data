title: "Volatility Measures: Beta, ATR, Implied Volatility"
summary: >
  Volatility measures describe how much and how quickly prices change, helping investors assess risk, position sizing,
  and potential losses. Different measures capture different dimensions of volatility, from market sensitivity to daily
  price ranges and future expectations. This lesson explains key volatility metrics and how they are used in practice.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: Volatility = how much prices swing"
  summary: >
    Learn what volatility means and why it matters. You’ll understand the difference between “how much it moves” and
    “whether it’s a good or bad investment” (volatility is a risk characteristic, not a moral judgment).
  key_points:
    - Volatility reflects the magnitude and frequency of price fluctuations.
    - Higher volatility usually means larger potential gains and losses over short periods.
    - Standard deviation measures total historical volatility of returns (how spread out returns are).
    - Beta compares an asset’s volatility/sensitivity to the broader market.
    - ATR measures typical daily price movement (range), useful for trading risk controls.
    - Implied volatility reflects market expectations of future uncertainty (forward-looking, options-based).
  subtopics:
    - Volatility vs risk vs return (simple framing)
    - Historical vs implied volatility (past vs expectations)
    - “Moves with the market” (beta) vs “moves per day” (ATR)
    - Why volatility spikes around news and earnings
  examples:
    - Market sensitivity example: >
        A stock with a beta of 1.5 moves more aggressively than the market.
        Higher potential returns come with higher downside risk.
    - Trading example: >
        ATR rises sharply after an earnings announcement.
        Traders may widen stop-loss levels to account for larger price swings.
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating volatility as inherently bad rather than as a risk characteristic.
    - Confusing volatility with direction (volatile can go up or down).
    - Using one volatility number without considering time horizon.
  questions_to_think:
    - If two stocks have the same return, why might the more volatile one feel “riskier”?
    - Why might volatility jump right after major news?

  title: "Intermediate: What each measure captures (and when to use it)"
  summary: >
    Learn how beta, standard deviation, ATR, Bollinger Bands, and maximum drawdown each describe a different angle of volatility.
    You’ll see why comparing the wrong metrics can lead to bad position sizing or misleading conclusions.
  key_points:
    - Standard deviation measures total historical volatility (return variability), often used for comparing funds.
    - Beta measures market sensitivity (systematic risk), best interpreted with an appropriate benchmark.
    - ATR measures average daily range, commonly used for stop placement and position sizing (trading-focused).
    - Bollinger Bands visualize volatility through price dispersion around a moving average.
    - Maximum drawdown focuses on worst-case historical losses, complementing “average” volatility measures.
    - Different measures can disagree because they measure different things.
  subtopics:
    - Standard deviation (returns-based) vs ATR (price-range-based)
    - Beta and benchmarks: what beta actually compares to
    - Bollinger Bands: visualizing expanding/contracting volatility
    - Drawdowns: why “worst case so far” matters
    - Matching metric to goal: long-term investor vs short-term trader
  examples:
    - Options example: >
        Implied volatility increases ahead of major economic events.
        Option prices become more expensive due to higher expected uncertainty.
    - "Bollinger Band example: Bands widen during a volatile period and tighten during consolidation, showing volatility expansion and contraction."
  common_mistakes:
    - Comparing beta and ATR as if they measure the same thing.
    - Ignoring drawdowns when focusing only on short-term volatility.
    - Using beta without checking if the benchmark is relevant (beta can mislead).
  questions_to_think:
    - When is beta more useful than ATR?
    - Why is maximum drawdown important for long-term investors?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Implied vs historical volatility, regime shifts, and risk control"
  summary: >
    Learn how implied volatility embeds expectations (and fear) about future moves, why it can diverge from historical volatility,
    and how volatility behaves across regimes (calm vs crisis). You’ll connect volatility to real decisions: leverage, sizing, and hedging.
  key_points:
    - Implied volatility is forward-looking and derived from option prices; it often rises before high-uncertainty events.
    - Historical volatility summarizes past realized moves; it may lag regime changes.
    - Comparing implied vs historical volatility requires context (upcoming events, earnings, macro announcements).
    - Volatility clusters: high volatility tends to follow high volatility (conceptual), affecting risk management.
    - Maximum drawdown and tail risk matter because extreme moves happen more often than “normal” models assume.
    - Practical risk management uses volatility to size positions, set stops, and limit portfolio concentration.
  subtopics:
    - Why implied volatility moves (demand for options, event risk)
    - Volatility risk premium (conceptual): why IV can be “high”
    - Regime shifts and volatility clustering (conceptual)
    - Tail risk and why averages can lie
    - Using volatility in position sizing (conceptual) and portfolio risk budgeting
  examples:
    - "IV divergence example: A stock has low recent historical volatility, but implied volatility jumps before earnings because the market expects a big move."
    - "Regime shift example: After a market shock, standard deviation and ATR stay elevated for weeks, so old risk settings become too tight."
  common_mistakes:
    - Comparing implied and historical volatility without considering upcoming events.
    - Assuming volatility will quickly revert to “normal” after a shock.
    - Using volatility-based stops without adapting to regime changes (too tight in high volatility, too loose in low volatility).
  questions_to_think:
    - How does implied volatility influence option pricing?
    - If implied volatility is far above historical volatility, what might the market be pricing in?
    - How would you adjust position size when ATR doubles?
