title: 5 Short Interest Metrics That Drive Stock Prices
summary: >
  Short interest metrics provide insight into bearish sentiment, market positioning, and potential supply-demand imbalances.
  By analyzing how many shares are sold short and how easily those positions can be closed, investors can better assess short squeeze risk,
  market conviction, and price volatility. This lesson explains the most important short interest metrics and how to interpret them.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: What short interest means (and why it can move prices)"
  summary: >
    Learn the core idea: short sellers borrow shares, sell them, and must later buy them back. That “eventual buyback” can become future demand,
    especially when many shares are shorted.
  key_points:
    - Short interest measures the number of shares sold short but not yet covered.
    - High short interest often reflects bearish sentiment (or hedging), but it is not proof a company is “bad.”
    - Short sellers must eventually buy shares back, creating future demand.
    - Short interest data is delayed and should not be treated as real-time.
    - Short squeezes happen when rising prices force shorts to buy back quickly, pushing prices higher.
  subtopics:
    - How short selling works (borrow → sell → buy back)
    - Short interest as “positioning,” not a prediction
    - Why forced buying can amplify rallies
    - Data delay: why timing matters
  examples:
    - "Basic shorting example: A trader shorts 100 shares at $10 hoping to buy back at $7. If price rises to $15 instead, closing requires buying at a loss."
    - Historical example: >
        GameStop experienced short interest exceeding 100% of its float in 2021.
        Extreme crowding led to forced buying and rapid price escalation.
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating high short interest as a guaranteed squeeze setup.
    - Treating short interest as real-time data, even though reports are delayed.
    - Confusing “shares short” with “percent short.”
  questions_to_think:
    - Why can short selling create future demand?
    - Why is delayed reporting a problem for trading decisions?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: The key metrics—short float %, short % of outstanding, and days to cover"
  summary: >
    Learn the main measurements used to judge crowding and exit difficulty. You’ll understand why the denominator (float vs outstanding)
    changes interpretation, and how volume affects the ability of shorts to unwind.
  key_points:
    - Short float percentage shows how crowded a short trade is relative to tradable shares.
    - Short % of outstanding shares gives a broader view including non-tradable holdings.
    - Days to cover estimates how quickly shorts could exit based on average daily volume.
    - A small float can make the same share count of shorts much riskier (crowding effect).
    - Rising price + high days to cover can increase squeeze risk because exits become harder.
  subtopics:
    - Short interest (shares) vs short float % (crowding)
    - Float vs outstanding: why they give different signals
    - Days to cover = short interest ÷ average daily volume
    - Volume dynamics: “can they actually get out?”
  examples:
    - Crowding example: >
        Company A has 5 million shares short with a float of 20 million shares.
        A high short float percentage indicates crowded positioning and higher squeeze risk.
    - Liquidity example: >
        A stock with 6 days to cover faces rising prices on heavy buying.
        Shorts may struggle to exit quickly, increasing volatility.
  common_mistakes:
    - Confusing short float percentage with short interest numbers.
    - Ignoring the impact of float size on short squeeze potential.
    - Looking at days to cover without checking whether volume is stable or event-driven.
  questions_to_think:
    - How does days to cover affect short squeeze risk?
    - Why can two stocks with the same shares short have very different squeeze risk?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Borrow cost, institutional ownership, and the squeeze ‘fuel’ mechanics"
  summary: >
    Learn the deeper forces that change squeeze dynamics: share availability to borrow, the cost of holding a short,
    and how institutional ownership can reduce tradable float. You’ll also learn why short interest alone is insufficient.
  key_points:
    - Borrow fee is the cost to borrow shares and often rises when shares are scarce, pressuring shorts to cover.
    - Institutional ownership can reduce effective tradable float, amplifying price moves when demand spikes.
    - Short interest can reflect hedging (pairs, options) and not purely “bearish conviction.”
    - Squeeze risk increases when crowding is high, borrow is tight/expensive, and liquidity is thin.
    - Short interest metrics should be interpreted together with price/volume behavior and catalysts (news, earnings, index changes).
    - Because data is delayed, risk can change faster than the reported numbers suggest.
  subtopics:
    - Borrow availability and borrow fee: “cost to stay short”
    - Institutional holdings and float reduction (effective float concept)
    - Positioning vs conviction: hedges and complex strategies
    - Catalyst + liquidity: why squeezes tend to happen around events
    - Practical read: combining metrics (crowding + days to cover + borrow fee + float)
  examples:
    - "Borrow fee example: A stock’s borrow fee spikes as shares become hard to borrow. Shorts face rising carrying costs and may cover earlier."
    - "Institutional float example: If institutions hold most shares and rarely trade them, the remaining float can be thin—so incremental buying pressure moves price more."
  common_mistakes:
    - Failing to consider volume and relative strength in analyzing short interest.
    - Assuming institutional ownership automatically stabilizes price (it can reduce float and increase squeezes).
    - Treating any short squeeze story as investable without checking liquidity and risk controls.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why does high short interest increase volatility?
    - Why can institutional ownership intensify price moves?
    - Which combination of metrics would make you most cautious—and why?

definitions:
  - term: Short Interest
    definition: The total number of shares that investors have sold short and not yet repurchased or covered.
  - term: Short Float Percentage
    definition: Short interest as a percentage of a stock’s float, indicating how crowded the short trade is.
  - term: Float
    definition: Shares available for public trading, excluding insider holdings and restricted stock.
  - term: Short % of Outstanding Shares
    definition: Short interest as a percentage of total shares outstanding, providing a different perspective than short float percentage.
  - term: Short Squeeze
    definition: A situation where a heavily shorted stock starts rising, forcing short sellers to buy back shares and driving prices higher.
  - term: Days to Cover
    definition: Short interest divided by average daily volume, estimating how many trading days it may take for shorts to cover.
  - term: Borrow Fee
    definition: The interest-like cost paid to borrow shares for short selling, which often rises when shares are scarce.
  - term: Institutional Holdings
    definition: Shares held by large investors such as mutual funds, pensions, and ETFs, which can reduce available float.

common_mistakes:
  - Confusing short float percentage with short interest numbers.
  - Ignoring the impact of float size on short squeeze potential.
  - Failing to consider volume and relative strength in analyzing short interest.
  - Treating short interest as real-time data, even though reports are delayed.
