title: Technical Indicators: RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages
summary: >
  Technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, and moving averages help traders analyze momentum, trend direction, and potential reversals.
  Each indicator captures different aspects of price behavior, and using them together provides a more balanced technical perspective.
  This lesson explains how these indicators work, how they differ, and how traders combine them effectively.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: What indicators do (they summarize price behavior)"
  summary: >
    Learn what technical indicators are and what they’re used for: simplifying price movement into signals about trend and momentum.
    You’ll understand the basic roles of moving averages (trend), RSI (momentum extremes), and MACD (momentum + trend shifts).
  key_points:
    - Moving averages smooth price data to highlight trend direction.
    - RSI measures momentum and identifies overbought or oversold conditions.
    - MACD analyzes momentum and trend strength using exponential moving averages.
    - Indicators are derived from past prices, so they are lagging (they react, not predict).
    - Indicators work best as tools for decisions, not as guarantees.
  subtopics:
    - Trend vs momentum (simple distinction)
    - Moving averages: why smoothing helps
    - RSI: overbought/oversold as “stretched,” not “must reverse”
    - MACD: comparing faster vs slower averages
    - Lagging nature: why signals come after moves begin
  examples:
    - Overbought example: >
        RSI rises above 70 while price continues climbing.
        Momentum is strong, but risk of a pullback increases.
    - Trend example: >
        The 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average.
        Often interpreted as a long-term bullish trend signal.
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating RSI overbought or oversold levels as automatic buy or sell signals.
    - Believing indicators “predict” the market rather than summarize what already happened.
    - Using indicators without any plan for exits or risk limits.
  questions_to_think:
    - If indicators are lagging, what kind of mistakes might that cause?
    - Why can RSI stay overbought for a long time in a strong trend?

  title: "Intermediate: How RSI, MACD, and moving averages differ (and what each is good for)"
  summary: >
    Learn the strengths and weaknesses of each indicator and when traders typically use them.
    You’ll understand crossovers, divergences, and how moving averages can act as trend filters.
  key_points:
    - RSI focuses on momentum extremes and can highlight potential reversals or trend strength.
    - RSI divergence can warn of weakening trends.
    - MACD crossovers often signal changes in momentum.
    - MACD combines trend and momentum via EMAs, often used to identify shifts rather than absolute levels.
    - Moving averages help define trend direction and can reduce whipsaws when used as filters.
    - Indicators should be confirmed with price action and risk management.
  subtopics:
    - RSI: thresholds (30/70) and what they imply
    - Divergence: why indicator vs price disagreement matters
    - MACD line vs signal line: crossover logic
    - Moving average crossovers vs slope (trend direction)
    - Whipsaw conditions: why sideways markets break indicators
  examples:
    - Crossover example: >
        The MACD line crosses above the signal line.
        Traders may interpret this as bullish momentum.
    - "RSI divergence example: Price makes a new high, but RSI makes a lower high—momentum is weakening even as price rises."
  common_mistakes:
    - Confusing the purpose of MACD and RSI, leading to conflicting trading signals.
    - Overreliance on a single indicator without considering how they interact.
    - Using crossover signals in choppy markets where whipsaws are common.
  questions_to_think:
    - How do MACD and RSI differ in their approach to measuring market momentum?
    - How can moving averages help filter noise?
    - What are the limitations of using only one of these indicators for trading decisions?

  title: "Advanced: Combining indicators into a ruleset (confirmation, regime filters, and risk management)"
  summary: >
    Learn how traders combine indicators without double-counting the same information, and how to adapt signals to market regimes.
    You’ll connect indicator use to trade planning: entries, exits, position sizing, and stop placement.
  key_points:
    - Indicators overlap because many are transformations of price; combining them should add confirmation, not redundancy.
    - Moving averages can act as a regime filter (trend vs range), changing how you interpret RSI/MACD.
    - In trends, RSI can be used as a “trend strength / pullback timing” tool rather than a reversal signal.
    - MACD is useful for detecting momentum shifts, but signals can lag and fail during sudden news moves.
    - Whipsaw risk increases in sideways markets; filters (trend slope, volatility checks) can reduce false signals.
    - Risk management is essential because any indicator can be wrong (stops, sizing, and predefined invalidation).
  subtopics:
    - Confirmation logic: trend filter + momentum trigger
    - Regime switching: trending vs ranging
    - Avoiding indicator “stacking” (multiple indicators saying the same thing)
    - Practical risk controls: stops, max loss per trade, position sizing (conceptual)
    - Backtesting mindset: why rules beat vibes
  examples:
    - "Trend-filter combo example: Only take long trades when price is above the 200-day MA; use MACD crossover for entry timing; use RSI to avoid entering when momentum is already extremely stretched."
    - "Whipsaw defense example: In a range-bound market, moving average crossovers trigger repeatedly; adding a trend-slope filter reduces trades during chop."
  common_mistakes:
    - Combining RSI + MACD + multiple moving averages and thinking “more indicators = more certainty.”
    - Ignoring market regime and applying the same signals in trends and ranges.
    - Skipping risk management because “the indicator said so.”
  questions_to_think:
    - How can traders effectively combine MACD and RSI to enhance their technical analysis?
    - What role does risk management play when using indicators?
    - How would you design a simple rule that avoids trading during whipsaw conditions?

definitions:
  - term: MACD
    definition: A momentum indicator that measures the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs), typically a 12-period and 26-period EMA. It includes a signal line derived from a nine-day EMA of the MACD line.
  - term: RSI
    definition: A momentum indicator that gauges price changes relative to recent highs and lows, indicating overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions.
  - term: Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    definition: A type of moving average that gives more weight to recent prices, used in calculating indicators like MACD.
  - term: Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    definition: A moving average that gives equal weight to all prices in the lookback period.
  - term: Crossover
    definition: A signal that occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above or below a longer-term moving average.
  - term: Divergence
    definition: A situation where price moves in one direction while an indicator moves in the opposite direction, hinting at weakening momentum.
  - term: Whipsaw
    definition: Choppy market conditions that cause frequent false signals.

common_mistakes:
  - Confusing the purpose of MACD and RSI, leading to conflicting trading signals.
  - Overreliance on a single indicator without considering how they interact.
  - Treating RSI overbought or oversold levels as automatic buy or sell signals.
  - Using indicators without price confirmation and risk management.
