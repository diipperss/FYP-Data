title: How Stock Prices Reflect Fundamentals and Market Sentiment
summary: >
  Stock prices are determined by both a company’s financial fundamentals and investor behavior in the market.
  This lesson explains how earnings, growth expectations, liquidity, market sentiment, and news interact to influence stock pricing,
  highlighting why prices can deviate from intrinsic value in the short term.

  summary: >
    Learn the simple idea behind stock prices: they move because of supply and demand, which is influenced by both
    business performance (fundamentals) and investor mood (sentiment). You’ll understand why prices can move even when the company didn’t change.
  key_points:
    - Stock prices are shaped by fundamental value and market behavior.
    - Fundamentals include earnings, revenue growth, cash flows, and long-term profit potential.
    - Prices move when demand to buy is greater than supply to sell (and vice versa).
    - News and stories can change investor expectations quickly, moving price before fundamentals change.
    - Short-term prices can deviate from intrinsic value because markets are emotional and forward-looking.
  subtopics:
    - Supply and demand: the basic pricing engine
    - Fundamentals vs “what the crowd thinks”
    - Why headlines move prices fast
    - Short-term vs long-term: why “intrinsic value” isn’t a daily thing
  examples:
    - Supply and demand example: >
        Positive media coverage or analyst upgrades can increase demand for a stock, driving up its price even if the company’s fundamentals have not changed.
        Investors need to distinguish between short-term sentiment-driven moves and long-term fundamental value.
    - "Simple expectation example: A company announces it may launch a new product next year. The stock rises today because investors expect future profits, even though current earnings didn’t change."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming strong earnings automatically lead to immediate price increases.
    - Thinking “the market is irrational” when price moves are actually expectation-driven.
    - Treating every short-term move as a fundamental signal.
  questions_to_think:
    - What’s one reason a stock could rise even if the company didn’t improve yet?
    - What’s one reason a stock could fall even if the business is still solid?

  summary: >
    Learn how markets price the future using expectations and valuation multiples. You’ll connect earnings results
    to what investors expected, and understand how sentiment and sector moves can override company-specific performance.
  key_points:
    - Investor expectations often drive short-term price movements more than actual results.
    - A stock can drop after “good” earnings if the market expected even better.
    - Valuation multiples (like P/E) reflect how optimistic investors are about future growth.
    - Sector sentiment can drag down individual stocks even when company fundamentals are stable.
    - Guidance and outlook can matter more than last quarter’s numbers.
  subtopics:
    - Expectations vs results: “beat” vs “miss” vs “priced in”
    - What a valuation multiple represents (optimism vs fear)
    - Sector rotation and sentiment contagion
    - Earnings vs guidance: why the future dominates
    - Basic framework: price ≈ (earnings) × (multiple)
  examples:
    - Expectations vs results example: >
        A company beats last quarter’s earnings but fails to meet higher market expectations, causing a decline in stock price despite positive results.
        Understanding investor expectations is crucial, as price movements reflect sentiment relative to anticipated performance, not just absolute results.
    - Sector sentiment example: >
        A retail company reports stable earnings, but negative news about overall consumer spending causes investors to sell across the sector, driving down the stock price.
        Investors may experience losses despite strong fundamentals, highlighting the importance of market sentiment and diversification.
  common_mistakes:
    - Focusing only on the earnings number and ignoring expectations and guidance.
    - Comparing P/E ratios across different industries without context.
    - Thinking sector-wide moves are always “unfair” rather than risk re-pricing.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why might a stock price fall even after strong earnings?
    - If two companies have the same earnings, why might investors pay a higher price for one?

  title: "Advanced: Liquidity, technical forces, and short-term deviations from intrinsic value"
  summary: >
    Learn how market microstructure and trading behavior influence price, especially in the short term.
    You’ll connect liquidity, volume, and technical behavior to volatility and explain why small-cap stocks can trade differently than large-caps.
  key_points:
    - Technical and market factors include liquidity, trading volume, investor sentiment, and overall economic conditions.
    - Liquidity affects how easily price moves: thin liquidity can create bigger swings and higher risk.
    - Small-cap stocks often trade with wider spreads and more price impact than large-caps.
    - News can trigger rapid repositioning, causing temporary overshoots or undershoots versus intrinsic value.
    - Technical analysis focuses on price/volume patterns that reflect crowd behavior (not fundamentals).
    - Understanding liquidity and market mechanics helps investors avoid costly execution and timing mistakes.
  subtopics:
    - Liquidity and market impact: why thin markets jump
    - Large-cap vs small-cap behavior (depth, volume, spreads)
    - Sentiment shocks and temporary mispricing
    - Technical analysis as “behavioral reading” (high-level)
    - Linking back to microstructure: spreads, slippage, order books (conceptual)
  examples:
    - Liquidity example: >
        A large-cap stock trades millions of shares daily, allowing easy buying and selling without major price changes. A small-cap stock trades infrequently, so investors demand a lower price to compensate for illiquidity risk.
        Portfolio strategies should consider liquidity risk, especially in smaller or thinly traded stocks.
    - "Microstructure example: A thinly traded stock has a wide spread and low depth. A market order pushes through several price levels, causing a sharp move even though fundamentals didn’t change."
  common_mistakes:
    - Ignoring liquidity differences when evaluating stock performance.
    - Using market orders in thin stocks and blaming “manipulation” for predictable slippage.
    - Treating technical signals as certainty rather than probability.
  questions_to_think:
    - How do liquidity and sentiment affect small-cap versus large-cap stock pricing?
    - When can technical forces temporarily overpower fundamentals?
