title: Introduction to Stocks
summary: >
  This lesson introduces stocks as the foundation of equity investing, explaining how they represent ownership in a corporation and why companies issue them.
  It connects stock ownership to shareholder rights, profit participation, and corporate financing, and sets the groundwork for understanding different stock types and market behavior.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: Stocks = ownership (but not the office chairs)"
  summary: >
    Learn what a stock is, what “ownership” actually means, and why companies sell shares.
    You’ll understand how shares represent a proportional claim on the business—not direct control of daily operations or physical assets.
  key_points:
    - A stock represents partial ownership (equity) in a corporation.
    - Owning shares means you own a slice of the company’s value and potential profits, not its day-to-day operations.
    - Shares determine proportional ownership: more shares (relative to total shares) = bigger stake.
    - Companies issue stock to raise capital for growth without taking on debt obligations.
    - Shareholders may receive dividends, but dividends are optional and depend on company policy and performance.
  subtopics:
    - What “equity” means in simple terms
    - Shares and proportional ownership
    - Why companies raise money by selling shares
    - Profits and shareholder returns: price gains vs dividends (intro)
    - Why stock ownership is different from owning a private small business
  examples:
    - Shares example: >
        A shareholder owning 33% of a company’s shares owns one-third of the equity, not one-third of the physical assets or day-to-day control.
    - IPO example: >
        A growing company launches an IPO to fund expansion, research, and marketing without borrowing money.
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming stock ownership guarantees control over company operations.
    - Believing that owning shares means you personally own the company’s assets outright.
  questions_to_think:
    - How does stock ownership differ from direct ownership of a private business?
    - Why might a company prefer issuing stock over taking on debt?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: Shareholder rights—profits, voting, and priorities"
  summary: >
    Learn what shareholders actually get: claims on profits, voting influence, and rights that differ by stock type.
    You’ll understand how voting power works and why common vs preferred stock have different trade-offs.
  key_points:
    - A stock is an equity security giving shareholders a claim on profits and residual value.
    - Shareholders can benefit through dividends and/or price appreciation, but dividends are discretionary.
    - Voting power determines influence over corporate decisions; it may differ by share class.
    - Common stock usually provides voting rights and higher upside, but is last in line during liquidation.
    - Preferred stock usually has dividend priority and higher claim in liquidation, but often lacks voting rights.
    - Ownership percentage matters, but corporate control also depends on voting structure and share classes.
  subtopics:
    - Shareholder rights: voting, dividends, information (high-level)
    - Residual claim: what “last in line” means
    - Common vs preferred: risk/return and priority differences
    - Share classes and voting power (conceptual)
    - Liquidation order (high-level: debt vs equity priority)
  examples:
    - Shares example: >
        An investor purchases common shares to gain voting rights and long-term growth potential rather than fixed income.
    - "Priority example: In liquidation, preferred shareholders typically get paid before common shareholders, but both generally come after creditors (conceptual)."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming “more shares” automatically means control, ignoring voting structures.
    - Thinking dividends are guaranteed like bond interest.
    - Confusing preferred stock with “safer stocks” without understanding trade-offs.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why might a company issue preferred shares instead of only common shares?
    - How can voting rights matter even if you own a small percentage of shares?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Share structure, dilution, and how ownership changes over time"
  summary: >
    Learn how share count and ownership evolve through financing and corporate decisions.
    You’ll connect share issuance and dilution to valuation per share and understand why ownership outcomes depend on the total share base, not just the number of shares you hold.
  key_points:
    - Ownership is proportional: your stake depends on your shares divided by total shares outstanding.
    - Issuing new shares can dilute existing shareholders’ percentage ownership, even if the company raises cash.
    - Per-share value depends on both business performance and share count (valuation per share concept).
    - Stock-based compensation and secondary offerings can increase share count over time.
    - Corporate actions (splits, buybacks) change share count mechanics without necessarily changing fundamentals.
    - Understanding dilution and share structure helps investors interpret headlines and long-term outcomes.
  subtopics:
    - Shares outstanding and ownership percentage
    - Dilution: why your slice can shrink
    - Per-share metrics (high-level): earnings per share intuition
    - Stock-based compensation and share issuance (conceptual)
    - How this connects to corporate actions (splits, buybacks) and valuation
  examples:
    - "Dilution example: You own 1,000 shares out of 100,000 total (1%). If the company issues 50,000 new shares and you don’t buy more, your ownership becomes 1,000 / 150,000 = 0.67%."
    - "Buyback intuition: If a company buys back shares and total shares fall, each remaining share represents a slightly larger ownership slice (all else equal)."
  common_mistakes:
    - Focusing only on share price and ignoring changes in share count.
    - Assuming dilution is always bad (it depends on what the company gains from raising capital).
    - Misunderstanding splits as changing ownership or value by themselves.
  questions_to_think:
    - If a company issues more shares to raise money, when could that still be good for shareholders?
    - Why do investors often track “per share” metrics instead of only total company profits?
