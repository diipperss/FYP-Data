title: Preferred vs. Common Stock: An Overview
summary: >
  This lesson compares preferred and common stock by examining their rights, risks, and return structures.
  It links income stability, voting power, and liquidation priority to different investor goals, helping learners
  understand why companies issue multiple share classes and how each fits into a portfolio.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: The core difference—income priority vs growth upside"
  summary: >
    Learn the simple trade-off: preferred stock is usually built for steadier income and higher priority,
    while common stock is built for ownership control (voting) and long-term growth upside.
  key_points:
    - Common stock is the “standard” stock most people buy; it benefits most from company growth.
    - Preferred stock usually pays dividends first and has higher priority if the company is liquidated.
    - Common shareholders usually have voting rights; preferred shareholders generally do not.
    - Preferred dividends are typically fixed and predictable; common dividends can change or disappear.
    - Common stock can rise much more in price, but also tends to be more volatile.
  subtopics:
    - What you “get” from each: dividends, voting, growth
    - Priority: who gets paid first (dividends and liquidation)
    - Why a fixed dividend changes risk/return
    - A simple investor goal match: income vs growth
  examples:
    - Preferred stock income example: >
        A company issues $25-par preferred shares paying a fixed 6% dividend, providing steady income regardless of stock price movements.
    - Common stock governance example: >
        Investors vote on board members and major corporate decisions.
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming common shareholders are paid dividends before preferred shareholders.
    - Thinking preferred stock behaves like common stock during strong growth periods.
  questions_to_think:
    - If you want steadier income, which stock type usually fits better?
    - If you want long-term growth, which stock type usually fits better?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: How returns differ—volatility, dividends, and bond-like features"
  summary: >
    Learn why preferred stock often behaves more like a bond, with features like par value and callability,
    and why that changes volatility and upside compared to common stock.
  key_points:
    - Preferred stock has bond-like features: par value and often a fixed dividend rate.
    - Preferred stock often has lower price volatility than common stock because returns are dividend-focused.
    - Common stock offers greater upside via price appreciation but carries higher risk and volatility.
    - Preferred returns can be capped by callability (issuer can redeem shares).
    - Preferred prices are often sensitive to interest rates (fixed-income-style behavior).
  subtopics:
    - Par value: why $25 preferred is “a thing”
    - Fixed dividend vs variable dividend
    - Callability: what it means for investors
    - Why preferred often moves with interest rates (conceptual)
    - Comparing total return: dividends + price movement
  examples:
    - Preferred stock risk example: >
        An issuer exercises the call feature to redeem preferred shares when interest rates fall.
    - Common stock growth example: >
        Shareholders benefit from rising share prices as the company expands its market share.
  common_mistakes:
    - Expecting preferred stock to benefit significantly from company growth like common stock.
    - Ignoring call risk and being surprised when preferred shares are redeemed.
    - Thinking “fixed dividend” means “guaranteed” (it still depends on issuer health and terms).
  questions_to_think:
    - How does callability change the risk profile of preferred shares?
    - Why might preferred stock be more sensitive to interest rate changes than common stock?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Why companies issue both—capital structure, incentives, and portfolio fit"
  summary: >
    Learn why firms issue different share classes and how to evaluate preferred vs common using investor goals,
    issuer incentives, and risk trade-offs (growth upside, income stability, and downside protection).
  key_points:
    - Companies issue multiple classes to broaden investor demand and financing flexibility.
    - Preferred stock can raise capital without giving up voting control like common stock might.
    - Preferred holders trade growth upside for higher priority and dividend-focused return.
    - Common holders accept lower priority for maximum upside and governance participation.
    - In stress scenarios, priority matters: preferred ranks ahead of common, but both generally rank behind debt.
    - Portfolio fit depends on objectives: income stability vs growth vs risk tolerance (including rate sensitivity).
  subtopics:
    - Capital structure hierarchy (high-level): debt > preferred > common
    - Control and governance: why founders like multiple classes
    - Evaluating preferred: dividend rate, call terms, issuer credit risk (conceptual)
    - Evaluating common: growth, profitability, dilution risk (conceptual)
    - Scenario thinking: growth boom vs rising rates vs recession
  examples:
    - "Issuer incentive example: A company wants to raise capital but avoid diluting voting control. Issuing preferred can attract income investors without changing common-share voting power."
    - "Cycle example: In a strong expansion, common may outperform due to upside. In a higher-rate environment, preferred pricing can be pressured because income alternatives become more attractive."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating preferred as “safe” without considering issuer risk and rate sensitivity.
    - Forgetting both preferred and common are equity and can lose value if the business deteriorates.
    - Comparing preferred yield to bond yield without comparing risk and seniority.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why might income-focused investors prefer preferred stock over common stock?
    - In what situations does common stock outperform preferred stock?
    - How would rising interest rates change the attractiveness of preferred shares?
