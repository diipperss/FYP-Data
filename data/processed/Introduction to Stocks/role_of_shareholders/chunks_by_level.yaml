title: Understanding Shareholders and Their Rights in a Company
summary: >
  Shareholders own a company through shares, entitling them to financial benefits, voting rights, and limited liability.
  This lesson links share ownership to control, dividends, and liquidation outcomes, while clarifying differences between
  common and preferred shareholders and explaining shareholder responsibilities and protections.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: What it means to be a shareholder"
  summary: >
    Learn what shareholders own, what they can gain (dividends and price appreciation), and the key protection:
    limited liability. You’ll also learn the basic difference between shareholders and stakeholders.
  key_points:
    - Shareholders own a portion of a company through shares and have potential financial returns.
    - Shareholders can benefit from dividends and stock price appreciation.
    - Limited liability protects shareholders from personal responsibility for company debts.
    - Shareholders are different from stakeholders (employees/customers may be stakeholders without owning shares).
    - Shareholder rights come from share ownership and the company’s rules/laws (varies by jurisdiction).
  subtopics:
    - Shareholder vs stakeholder (simple distinction)
    - How shareholders make money: dividends and price appreciation
    - Limited liability: what you are and aren’t responsible for
    - Why owning shares doesn’t mean running the company day-to-day
  examples:
    - "Limited liability example: If a company goes bankrupt, shareholders can lose their investment, but they generally don’t owe the company’s debts personally."
    - Common shareholder rights example: >
        A common shareholder can vote on board elections, mergers, or other key corporate actions and may participate in class-action suits if the company engages in wrongdoing.
        Voting provides influence over company governance; returns are tied to dividends and stock appreciation.
  common_mistakes:
    - Confusing shareholders with stakeholders.
    - Assuming shareholders are personally liable for company debts.
    - Thinking owning one share gives meaningful control over company decisions.
  questions_to_think:
    - What does limited liability protect you from?
    - If you own shares, how can you benefit financially?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: Voting rights, governance, and priority in liquidation"
  summary: >
    Learn how shareholder voting works, what the board of directors does, and how common and preferred shareholders
    differ in dividends, control, and liquidation priority.
  key_points:
    - Voting rights allow influence over major decisions, such as board elections and mergers.
    - Voting power typically increases with the number of shares held, and can be concentrated with institutions.
    - The board of directors is elected to oversee strategy and management on behalf of shareholders.
    - In liquidation, shareholders receive remaining assets after creditors are paid.
    - Preferred shareholders often receive dividends first and have higher liquidation priority, but usually have limited voting rights.
    - Common shareholders usually have voting rights and greater upside, but are last in liquidation priority.
  subtopics:
    - Shareholder voting: what gets voted on (board, mergers, major actions)
    - The board of directors: oversight role (high-level)
    - Common vs preferred rights: control vs income priority
    - Liquidation waterfall (conceptual): creditors before shareholders
    - Why institutions can influence outcomes more than individuals
  examples:
    - Preferred shareholder priority example: >
        A preferred shareholder receives a fixed dividend before common shareholders and may have priority in liquidation, but usually cannot vote on company matters.
        Provides steady income and reduced risk in liquidation but limited control over corporate decisions.
    - Voting influence example: >
        An individual investor with a small number of shares has minimal voting influence, whereas a large institutional investor can significantly sway outcomes.
        Understanding voting influence helps investors gauge control and impact in shareholder meetings.
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming every share class has the same voting rights.
    - Forgetting that shareholders are paid after creditors in liquidation.
    - Treating “voting” as the same as “managing” the company.
  questions_to_think:
    - How do the rights and risks of common shareholders differ from those of preferred shareholders?
    - Why might a company prefer shareholders to elect a board rather than vote on every decision?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Shareholder protections, activism, and responsibilities"
  summary: >
    Learn how shareholder protections work beyond voting: disclosures, legal rights, and collective action.
    You’ll also understand shareholder responsibilities (informed voting, monitoring) and how governance outcomes can affect value.
  key_points:
    - Shareholders have protections such as access to disclosures and legal remedies when wrongdoing occurs (jurisdiction-dependent).
    - Voting is one control mechanism; activism and engagement can influence strategy and capital allocation.
    - Minority shareholders may have limited influence individually, making governance structure important.
    - Share class design (dual-class, different voting rights) can concentrate control even with small economic ownership.
    - Shareholders can hurt their own outcomes if they ignore governance, dilution, or corporate actions.
    - Responsible ownership includes understanding proposals, voting when relevant, and tracking key events (dividends, restructurings).
  subtopics:
    - Shareholder protections and disclosures (high-level; varies by market)
    - Class actions and collective rights (conceptual)
    - Shareholder activism: when large investors push change
    - Dual-class shares and control vs ownership (conceptual)
    - Investor responsibilities: governance awareness and corporate action deadlines
  examples:
    - "Governance impact example: Investors vote against a compensation plan viewed as misaligned with performance, pressuring the board to revise incentives."
    - "Dual-class example: A founder holds shares with extra votes, retaining control even if they own a minority of the company’s economic value."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming voting rights always match economic ownership (they may not).
    - Ignoring governance structure until a crisis happens.
    - Treating shareholder rights as identical across countries and exchanges.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why might a company issue both common and preferred shares?
    - When could shareholder activism be beneficial—and when could it be harmful?
    - How might dual-class structures change the meaning of “shareholder control”?
