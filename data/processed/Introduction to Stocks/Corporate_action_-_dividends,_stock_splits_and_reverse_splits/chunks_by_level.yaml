title: Understanding Corporate Actions
summary: >
  This lesson explains corporate actions as strategic decisions that alter share structure, ownership, or investor returns.
  It links these actions to earlier concepts such as share count, valuation, and shareholder rights, helping investors
  understand how corporate decisions translate into portfolio outcomes.

  title: "Beginner: What corporate actions are (and why you should care)"
  summary: >
    Learn what corporate actions are, the most common types you’ll see as a shareholder, and the simple idea behind them:
    companies can change share structure or distribute value, which can change what you own or what you receive.
  key_points:
    - Corporate actions are company-initiated events that directly affect shareholders.
    - They can change share count, ownership structure, or cash flows to investors.
    - Some corporate actions pay you value directly (dividends); others change how shares are packaged (splits).
    - Corporate actions do not automatically make you richer; they change structure, not fundamentals.
    - Brokerages typically notify investors and show corporate actions in portfolio tools.
  subtopics:
    - Corporate action vs normal price movement
    - Cash payouts (dividends) vs structural changes (splits)
    - What “share ownership” means in practice
    - How broker platforms show corporate actions and notifications
  examples:
    - Dividend example: >
        A company declares a cash dividend of $0.50 per share.
        An investor holding 100 shares receives $50 in cash.
        Dividends represent a direct return on investment and can influence total shareholder yield.
        Shareholders gain immediate income without selling shares.
        The stock price may adjust downward on the ex-dividend date to reflect the payout.
    - "Simple split intuition: If you own 10 shares and the company does a 2-for-1 split, you own 20 shares at about half the price each—your total value is roughly unchanged (ignoring market moves)."
  common_mistakes:
    - Thinking a stock split creates value by itself.
    - Ignoring broker notifications and being surprised by portfolio changes.
  questions_to_think:
    - If a split doesn’t change fundamentals, why might the market still react?
    - Which corporate actions affect you through cash vs through share count?

  title: "Intermediate: Voluntary vs mandatory actions and how portfolio outcomes change"
  summary: >
    Learn how corporate actions are classified, how they flow through brokerage systems, and how they impact share count,
    price, and investor returns. You’ll also learn key dates and what to watch for.
  key_points:
    - Corporate actions can be mandatory (automatic for all shareholders) or voluntary (requires investor choice).
    - Splits and reverse splits adjust share count and price without directly changing total investment value at the moment of the action.
    - Dividends distribute cash and can affect the stock price around the ex-dividend date.
    - Spin-offs redistribute ownership by giving shareholders shares in a new company.
    - Voluntary actions have deadlines; missing them can reduce benefits or force a default outcome.
    - Brokerages provide tools and notices to track events, elections, and deadlines.
  subtopics:
    - Mandatory vs voluntary corporate actions (clear examples)
    - Key dates (high-level): declaration, ex-date, record date, payable date (conceptual)
    - How share count and price mechanically adjust
    - Dividend mechanics and why price often adjusts on ex-date
    - Spin-offs: what you receive and why it can change your portfolio composition
  examples:
    - Forward stock split example: >
        A company with 10 million shares priced at $9 each executes a 3-for-1 forward stock split.
        The total number of shares increases to 30 million, and the share price adjusts to $3.
        Each shareholder’s proportional ownership remains unchanged, but the lower price can make shares more accessible to small investors and may improve liquidity.
        Investors now hold three times the number of shares they previously owned.
        The total investment value remains the same, but they can trade shares more easily due to the lower per-share price.
    - Reverse stock split example: >
        A company with 10 million shares priced at $9 each executes a 1-for-2 reverse stock split.
        The total number of shares reduces to 5 million, and the share price increases to $18.
        Reverse splits are often used to maintain minimum listing requirements or enhance the perceived value of a stock.
        Each investor’s total investment value stays the same, but the number of shares held decreases.
        Reverse splits may reduce the number of small shareholders and can affect liquidity.
    - Spin-off example: >
        A parent company creates a new independent subsidiary and distributes its shares to existing shareholders.
        For example, a shareholder holding 100 shares of the parent company may receive 10 shares of the new company.
        Investors gain ownership in a separate business in addition to their original holdings.
        Spin-offs allow shareholders to participate in growth potential of the new company while retaining their stake in the parent company.
  common_mistakes:
    - Ignoring voluntary action deadlines and losing potential benefits.
    - Misreading reverse splits as “the company improved” rather than a structural change (often done for compliance).
    - Forgetting that dividends can reduce price mechanically on ex-date (total value = stock + cash, ignoring market moves).
  questions_to_think:
    - What is the difference between a voluntary and a mandatory corporate action?
    - Why can a reverse split improve a stock’s “look” without improving its business?
    - How do spin-offs change what you own even if you did nothing?

  title: "Advanced: Corporate actions, valuation, and investor strategy"
  summary: >
    Learn the strategic “why” behind corporate actions and how to interpret them with valuation and incentives.
    You’ll connect actions to signaling, liquidity, shareholder rights, and long-term portfolio planning.
  key_points:
    - Corporate actions can be strategic signals: management may optimize liquidity, investor base, or capital return.
    - Splits may improve accessibility and trading liquidity, but don’t change intrinsic value.
    - Reverse splits can help meet listing rules but may also reflect underlying business stress; context matters.
    - Dividends can indicate mature cash generation, but may limit reinvestment; total return matters more than payout alone.
    - Spin-offs can “unlock” value by separating businesses, changing valuation multiples and focus.
    - Investor decisions should consider taxes, reinvestment, portfolio rebalancing, and thesis alignment (jurisdiction-dependent).
  subtopics:
    - Why companies choose splits (liquidity, optics, accessibility)
    - Reverse splits: compliance vs distress interpretation
    - Dividends: payout ratios, sustainability, and total return framing
    - Spin-offs: sum-of-the-parts logic and multiple re-rating (conceptual)
    - Investor actions: reinvest/dividend strategy, rebalancing after spin-offs
  examples:
    - "Dividend strategy example: An investor focused on income prefers stable dividend payers, while a growth-focused investor prioritizes reinvestment—both should compare total return, not just payout."
    - "Spin-off valuation example: After a spin-off, the market may value the high-growth subsidiary at a higher multiple than the parent previously received, changing perceived value even if operations are unchanged."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating splits as value creation instead of a packaging change.
    - Assuming reverse splits are always bad or always good (context matters).
    - Ignoring tax and portfolio impact after dividends or spin-offs (rules vary by country).
  questions_to_think:
    - How do corporate actions reinforce the concept of share ownership?
    - Why do companies use stock splits or reverse splits instead of changing fundamentals?
    - How should investors prepare for voluntary corporate actions?
    - What corporate action would most likely change your portfolio composition overnight, and why?
