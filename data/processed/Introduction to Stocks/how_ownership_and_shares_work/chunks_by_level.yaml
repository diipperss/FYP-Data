title: Introduction to Stocks and Share Ownership
summary: >
  This lesson expands on stock ownership by explaining how shares define economic rights, control, and valuation.
  It links share issuance, ownership structure, and market capitalization to investor returns, while introducing
  practical concepts such as fractional shares and buybacks.

beginner:
  title: "Beginner: Shares are the unit of ownership"
  summary: >
    Learn what a “share” actually is, what rights it represents, and why buying shares means taking on business risk.
    You’ll understand that shares determine your slice of the company, and not all shares have the same rights.
  key_points:
    - Shares are standardized units of ownership that represent an equity stake in a company.
    - Your shares determine your proportional economic rights (profits) and sometimes voting rights (control).
    - Shares are non-reimbursable: if the business performs badly, you are not guaranteed repayment.
    - Share classes exist: common and preferred can offer different rights and priorities.
    - Fractional shares let investors buy smaller portions, making expensive stocks more accessible.
  subtopics:
    - Shares vs “the company”: ownership slice concept
    - Economic rights (profits) vs control rights (voting)
    - Risk: why equity value can go down without repayment
    - Common vs preferred at a high level
    - Fractional shares: how you can own “0.1” of a share
  examples:
    - Fractional share example: >
        An investor with limited capital buys 0.1 shares of a $1,000 stock, gaining proportional exposure.
    - "Simple ownership example: If you own 100 shares out of 10,000 outstanding shares, you own 1% of the company’s equity."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming all shareholders have equal rights regardless of share class.
    - Expecting guaranteed repayment of invested capital.
    - Treating “share price” as the same thing as “company value.”
  questions_to_think:
    - If you own shares, what are you actually entitled to (economically and in control)?
    - Why is equity risk different from lending money to a company?

intermediate:
  title: "Intermediate: Issuance, authorized vs outstanding, and market capitalization"
  summary: >
    Learn how companies define and issue shares, how ownership structure is measured, and how valuation connects to
    share count through market capitalization. You’ll also understand public vs private share distribution at a high level.
  key_points:
    - Companies define authorized shares (legal maximum) and decide how many to issue.
    - Outstanding shares represent current ownership and drive ownership percentages.
    - Market capitalization equals share price multiplied by outstanding shares.
    - Issuing more shares changes ownership distribution and can dilute existing shareholders.
    - Public shares trade on regulated markets; private shares often come from options or private placements.
  subtopics:
    - Authorized shares vs issued shares vs outstanding shares
    - How issuance changes ownership and dilution (conceptual)
    - Market cap vs share price: why both matter
    - Public vs private shares (high-level differences)
    - Board control over issuance (why it matters)
  examples:
    - Share issuance example: >
        A company authorizes 10 million shares and issues 8 million, establishing ownership distribution and valuation.
    - "Market cap example: If a stock trades at $50 and has 100 million outstanding shares, the market cap is $5 billion."
  common_mistakes:
    - Treating shares and stocks as identical concepts without understanding structural differences.
    - Thinking a higher share price automatically means a “bigger” company (ignoring share count).
    - Ignoring dilution risk when companies issue new shares.
  questions_to_think:
    - How do outstanding shares influence a company’s valuation?
    - Why can two companies with the same share price have very different market caps?

advanced:
  title: "Advanced: Buybacks, treasury shares, and per-share value"
  summary: >
    Learn how buybacks change share count and per-share metrics, and why investors track per-share measures like earnings per share.
    You’ll connect buybacks to incentives, valuation, and long-term shareholder outcomes.
  key_points:
    - Buybacks reduce outstanding shares, increasing each remaining share’s ownership slice (all else equal).
    - Companies repurchase shares for reasons like returning capital, offsetting dilution, or signaling confidence.
    - Shares repurchased are typically held as treasury shares or retired (treatment varies).
    - Buybacks can increase earnings per share (EPS) mechanically even if total earnings don’t change.
    - Buybacks are not automatically good: using too much cash or buying back at expensive valuations can hurt long-term value.
    - Understanding share count changes helps investors interpret returns beyond price charts.
  subtopics:
    - Buybacks vs dividends: two ways to return capital
    - Treasury shares (high-level): repurchased shares held by the company
    - EPS mechanics (conceptual): why fewer shares can raise EPS
    - Incentives and trade-offs: when buybacks help vs hurt
    - Linking back to valuation: per-share value vs total company value
  examples:
    - Buyback example: >
        A company repurchases shares, reducing outstanding shares and increasing earnings per share for remaining investors.
    - "EPS mechanics example: A company earns $100M with 100M shares (EPS=$1). If it buys back to 80M shares with the same earnings, EPS becomes $1.25—even without business growth."
  common_mistakes:
    - Assuming buybacks always create value (price paid and opportunity cost matter).
    - Confusing EPS growth from buybacks with true business growth.
    - Ignoring that buybacks can be used to offset dilution from stock-based compensation.
  questions_to_think:
    - Why might a company repurchase its own shares?
    - How can buybacks raise EPS without improving the business?
    - When could buybacks be a bad use of capital?
